These include thinking, communication, social, research and self-management skills.</p>\n<p>We also aim to develop appropriate attitudes, including appreciation, commitment, confidence, cooperation, creativity, curiosity, empathy, enthusiasm, independence, integrity, respect and tolerance.</p>\n<p>In addition, students are encouraged to apply all that they have learned by taking action, not only in the School community, but also in the wider world.

The development of language is fundamental to that need to communicate; it supports and enhances our thinking and understanding.

However, these three aspects are so inextricably linked they are best not thought of as discrete processes.</p><p>Language plays a vital role in the construction of meaning. It empowers the learner and provides an intellectual framework to support conceptual development and critical thinking. In the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP), it is recognized that the teaching of language should be in response to the previous experience, needs and interests of the student, rather than the consequence of a predetermined, prescriptive model for delivering language. Fragmenting learning into the acquisition of isolated skill sets can create difficulties for learners&mdash;for example, learners may be able to read, write and spell words correctly in isolation but may not be able to read, write or spell those same words in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Learners&rsquo; needs are best served when they have opportunities to engage in learning within meaningful contexts, rather than being presented with the learning of language as an incremental series of skills to be acquired.</strong></p><p>At ARIS, the language profiles of students in are complex and diverse. The influence of mother-tongue development is significant for all learners. <strong>Development of mother-tongue language is crucial for cognitive development, and in maintaining cultural identity.</strong> Success in mother-tongue development is a strong predictor of long-term academic achievement, including acquisition of other languages.</p><h2>English as an Additional Language (EAL) Program</h2><p>Our students come to us with diverse cultural identities and language skills.

Our students come to us with diverse cultural identities and language profiles. The English as an Additional Language (EAL) department seeks to assist students in integrating into an English-speaking environment so that they feel comfortable at our school. An equally important concern is to enable students to access all curriculum areas. Therefore, EAL students attend most classes with their peers.</li><li>In order to enable students to develop confidence, skills and knowledge, EAL teachers work alongside class teachers to plan, teach and assess students&rsquo; understanding of our curriculum.

A report is sent bi weekly to the Head of Primary.The reports reflect on the support currently received by the students, as well as the EAL teacher&rsquo;s observations on the students&rsquo; ability to access the curriculum. In addition, EAL teachers attend parent-teacher conferences and include learning with the EAL teacher in the students&rsquo; portfolios.</li></ul><h3>Practice</h3><ul><li>Al-Rayan believes that students learn language, about language and through language. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are not separate but inter-related. Our approach to teaching language is holistic. Grammar is taught in context, often related to something the students are writing, and also when speaking, listening and reading.</li><li>All teachers at the school are considered to be language teachers, not only the EAL teachers.</li><li>As students begin their English language learning process, we recognise that each one of them comes to us with a wealth of knowledge and skills. We encourage students to use their mother tongue to develop English skills. For this reason, we allow students to use their own language when appropriate. For higher Primary students, we expect them to use bilingual dictionaries and other reference materials in their mother tongue to assist their learning.</li><li>Teachers who speak the mother tongue assist in translation for a period of time till the student can understand the basic spoken English.</li><li>In the early stages of learning a language, learners may go through what is called &lsquo;the silent stage.&rsquo; We respect this. As students begin to speak in English, we celebrate their courage. In the process of learning English, students will make mistakes. We recognize that making mistakes is an essential part of learning needed to develop language skills.</li><li>At ARIS, we use literature from around the world to embrace the student body&rsquo;s multiculturalism.

At the discretion of the Head of Secondary, additional assessment may be required to fulfil the course requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Compensation (make-up) for extended absences for medical reasons should be arranged through the subject teacher(s) in consultation with the Head of Secondary. Students are responsible for making up all missed work, whether or not an absence was excused. Credit will not be given for work made up after an unexcused absence.</p>\n\n<h3>Excusable and Inexcusable Absences</h3>\n\n<h4>Excusable</h4>\n\n<p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved by the Head of Secondary.  The Faculty will make reasonable efforts to assist students in making up school work for excused absences, but will also be considering that in doing so their attention may be diverted from the needs of the majority of students in the class.  Students absent on the day of a test are expected to make up the test immediately upon return to school and may be required to do this during break time.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of illness or other unforeseen absence, parents are requested to call Reception and report the student’s absence by 08.00 latest. They should then follow-up with a note on the student’s return to class.  When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a planned absence form and return it to their Homeroom Teacher.</p>\n\n<h4>Inexcusable</h4>\n\n<p>Inexcusable absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Head of Secondary.  Work missed for such absences must be completed but will be not be given credit and will be graded as zero.  Inexcusable absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p>\n\n<p>Following any non-school related absence from class, students must immediately on their return provide their Homeroom Teacher with a clear written explanation from parents explaining the reason for the absence.  The absence will be classified as inexcusable until an adequate explanation is received.  Parents should notify Reception each day of the absence, unless the school has been notified of a protracted absence in advance.</p>\n\n<h3>Truancy</h3>\n\n<p>The school will attempt to contact the parents if the student is inexplicably absent. Truancy is considered to be a student missing part or all of the school day without the parents\' and the school\'s permission.  Going off campus without permission during the school day constitutes truancy.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, truancy has a deleterious effect on the student\'s educational progress. The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing procedures to deal with truancy and the consequences thereof.  Disciplinary action may entail up to three days suspension, which again will be permanently on record. </p> \n',NULL,'normal','attendance-policy',NULL,'2014-12-16 09:19:17','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,NULL),(109,'Security Policy',104,NULL,'<p>Some say we live in a dangerous world.
