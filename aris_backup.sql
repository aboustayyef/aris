Our Primary School offers an engaging, quality curriculum from the Playgroup phase (ages 2-3), followed by the Primary Years Programme (PYP) from Nursery through to Year 6 (ages 3-12). Our Primary School, now a PYP Candidate School, is seeking authorization from the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) for the PYP. The IB PYP educational philosophy provides a framework that enables us to educate our children to face the challenges of the 21st century by guiding and supporting them to become independent, life-long learners; learners who are responsible, productive, insightful and compassionate; learners motivated to become peaceful and internationally-minded citizens of the world.</p><p>Our programme at ARIS focuses on developing independent, skilled learners through Inquiry&ndash;based teaching and learning. It is a student-centred approach that allows broad scope combined with rigour, and that strongly encourages a global perspective. Although based on the PYP, our programme is compatible with both the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) framework and the British National Curriculum.</p><p>At ARIS, each and every child is unique. Our teachers and staff are dedicated to bringing out the best in each individual. As Paulo Coelho once remarked, &ldquo;A teacher isn&rsquo;t someone who teaches something, but someone who inspires the student to give of his or her best in order to discover what he or she already knows.&rdquo;</p><p><br />I am privileged and excited to be a part of this dynamic school community, and hope to demonstrate in practice our commitment and enthusiasm for everything we do.</p><p>Yours Sincerely,&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/people/dania-sadek\">Dania Sadek</a></p>',NULL,'normal','from-the-head-of-primary',NULL,'2015-02-25 17:47:16','2015-04-04 08:03:32',0,'ttrumper@aris.edu.gh'),(11,'Mission and Aims',1,'Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, non-discriminatory community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.','<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/mission.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><h2>Driving Principles</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Respect</td><td>Co-operation</td><td>Honesty</td><td>Compassion</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Mission</h2><p>Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.</p><p>The school is dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient and socially responsible students able to take initiatives, and endowed with the knowledge, skills and global awareness necessary to continue their education and become active contributors to the global community.</p><p>It is our task to keep the welfare and wellbeing of our students at the forefront and provide them with a morally sound environment.</p><h2>Aims</h2><p>By 2018, Al-Rayan International School will be recognised nationally and internationally as a leading international school in Ghana, providing a stimulating multicultural learning environment in accordance with the best international standards in education. ARIS will also ensure high quality school support programmes that positively influence less advantaged students&rsquo; opportunities to access teaching and learning.</p><p>ARIS students and staff will work well in teams and make a positive contribution to the school and to the wider world. Students will enjoy a programme of extended learning opportunities and a school climate characterised by academic excellence, fairness, trust, and mutual respect.</p><h2>Ethos</h2><blockquote>&ldquo;O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of ALLAH is the most righteous of you. Indeed, ALLAH is knowing and Acquainted&rdquo; (Quran / Al- Hujraat 49:13).</blockquote><p>At Al-Rayan International School our Ethos aspires to follow the Quranic injunctions to ensure that the children and community we serve are able to recognise differences as a blessing and something to benefit their learning positively. We encourage children to &ldquo;know&rdquo; each other by means of tolerance, respect, understanding and gender equality, all through the exchange of knowledge in a global community.</p><p>In order to nurture a moral compass in the children, ARIS implements a holistic approach to Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural (SMSC) development. We deeply value the SMSC aspects of life that help us to understand what it is to be human. This richness of SMSC is threaded through our school environment. Adults lead the way in empowering children to learn about the world beyond the classroom and fathom their place in it, a world with a multiplicity of backgrounds, views and faiths; to be accepted, cherished and understood.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colours. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.&rdquo; (Quran / Ar-Room 30:22)</blockquote><p>It is this school environment which demonstrates that children at ARIS possess the tools to engage positively with the world at a local, national and global level. By having four Golden rules of Respect, Co-operation, Honesty and Compassion children are always reminded about these tenets within the manifestation of acceptable behaviour.</p><blockquote>&ldquo; O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames.&rdquo; (Quran / Al-Hurrat 49:11)</blockquote>','','normal','mission-and-aims',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2015-04-06 17:06:57',0,'ttrumper@aris.edu.gh'),(12,'Why ARIS?',1,'We are committed to inspiring students to attain their fullest potential through a broad based curriculum that promotes critical thinking, fosters self-motivation, and encourages self- development.','<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/why-aris.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Al-Rayan International School (ARIS) was established in September 2003.

It is our task to keep the welfare and wellbeing of our students at the forefront and to provide them with a morally sound learning environment that is respectful of difference.</p><p>ARIS routinely provides high quality school support programmes that enable all students, regardless of academic background, access to improved learning opportunities.</p><p>The ethos of the school, and the rules by which it governs itself, are founded on respect, fairness and trust--qualities which, we believe, are conducive to young people\'s learning, wellbeing and development.</p><p>To sustain this ethos, ARIS is fortunate to have highly professional and dynamic teams of educators, who are committed to finding fulfilment in their work and to continuous learning and development.</p><p>We strongly encourage our students to learn foreign languages, exposing them to different cultures and different linguistic systems, and thereby enabling an informed awareness of diversities and similarities in the global community. We currently offer Arabic, English, French and Hindi. We also provide Arabic Language classes on Saturdays. This latter programme caters for more than 120 students from other schools in Ghana.</p><p>Equally, we encourage students to recognize and grow from their own cultural roots.

Most importantly, the policy is <em>inclusive</em> rather than <em>exclusive,</em> enabling, insofar as is possible, equity of access to the high quality learning environment that ARIS strives to offer.</p><p>This document depicts the relevant policy and its context, outlines certain of the procedures whereby the policy is effected, and where further explanation may be appropriate, provides some account of the rationale.</p><p>The roots of ARIS are grounded in an indigenous Ghanaian population. However, the student body also reflects much diversity, stemming from relatively mobile families often linked to the world beyond Ghana\'s borders and beyond the region of West Africa via, for example, commercial businesses (at sole trader, corporate and multinational levels), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) charitable foundations and diplomatic missions.</p><p>Collectively, youngsters (now at any age between 4 and 16) whose parents seek their enrolment are exposed to an international <em>Weltanschauung</em> from the outset, if only by reason of peer diversity. International-mindedness is stimulated by everyday social interactions as well as the intrinsic elements of the school\'s globally-referenced curricular content, which is conducive to developing global perspectives.</p><p>A key tenet of the ARIS Mission Statement and Aims is&nbsp;inclusiveness:</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"mission\">Mission</h3><p>Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.</p><p>The school is dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient and socially responsible students able to take initiatives, and endowed with the knowledge, skills and global awareness necessary to continue their education and become active contributors to the global community.</p><p>It is our task to keep the welfare and wellbeing of our students at the forefront and provide them with a morally sound environment.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"aims\">Aims</h3><p><em> By 2018, Al-Rayan International School will be recognized nationally and internationally as a leading international school in Ghana, providing a stimulating multicultural learning environment in accordance with the best international standards in education. . . </em></p><p>The above Mission and Aims are congruent in all respects with the International Baccalaureate Mission Statement.</p><p>Although sponsored by a charitable foundation, The Ghana Society for Islamic Education and Reformation (GSIER), ARIS is a private school largely funded by revenue from tuition fees. Some potential students, therefore, will be unable to enrol because of the (albeit modest) cost of tuition. Establishment of a scholarship fund will be considered as soon as financial circumstances permit.</p><p>A further limitation on a wholly inclusive Admissions Policy is the provision of facilities for the disabled, which are currently inadequate. Again, when financial circumstances permit, improvements will be made in this regard. It is possible that the Student Representative Council will decide to initiate a fund-raising exercise to accelerate such improvements.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"foundation\">Admission to Playgroup</h3><p>We would like to introduce you to the first stage of school life, known as the Early Years Foundation Stage-EYFS. This includes mainly the Pre-Nursery year. For admission to Pre-Nursery, the eligibility criterion is that the child should have completed 2 years by 31 December of their year of entry, and by the availability of space. No entry exam required.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3>Admission to Primary Years Programme (PYP) Nursery &ndash; Year 6</h3><p>ARIS offers Primary Years Programme (PYP) from Nursery class through year 6 (ages 3-11). For our youngest applicants, applying to Nursery, the eligibility criterion is that the child should have completed 3 years by 31 December of their year of entry, and by the availability of space. No entry exam required from Nursery through year 2.</p><p>For all other admissions; the child should have reached the appropriate age to enter such class, please refer to Year/Class/Grade chart. We place students into the appropriate class based on their age on 31 December of their year of entry. A level assessment is required for enrolment in years 3-6. The assessment is to determine level and not admission. Pupils are placed in a class with his/her age group. In exceptional cases, the cut-off date may be extended for special placement if:</p><ul><li>The cut-off date in the child&rsquo;s country of origin</li><li>The child&rsquo;s successful completion of the equivalent grade elsewhere</li><li>A transcript or report cards from the previous year demonstrating exceptional academic performance and social skills</li></ul><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3>Admission to Primary Years Programme (PYP) - Support Programme</h3><p>All pupils who come under the English as a Second Language (ESL), Special Education Needs (SEN), Individual Education Plan (IEP), or Individual Language Plan (ILP) are placed in a support programme under the direct supervision of that department. Eligibility is based on our ability to provide service to the applicant; and the potential of the applicant to benefit from the Special Educational services available. When it appears that it could be beneficial for the student, he or she might be placed in a lower grade than requested.</p><p>The final decision on grade placement will be taken by the school based on all the information gathered through the application process. ARIS reserves the right to deny admission or re-enrolment to any applicant if, in its opinion, there were reasons to believe that admission or re-enrolment would not be in the best interest of the applicant or ARIS. We also reserve the right to postpone admission, if a class is full. In this case, the applicant is placed on a waiting list. The qualified applicants are then accepted in order of date of application, subject to the above priorities.</p><p>The final decision on grade placement will be taken by the school Principal based on all the information gathered through the application process.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission7-9\">Admission to Years 7 &ndash; 9</h3><p>By now the reader will be asking &lsquo;What exactly must my child do to enrol at ARIS?\' The reader should already have clicked the &lsquo;Contact Us\' button on the ARIS website and begun to engage in the form-filling and information-gathering process.</p><p>Because youngsters in different parts of the world begin formal schooling at markedly different chronological ages, a useful preliminary reference might be the chart (on the website) showing the correlation between chronological age and the Year/Class/Grade levels at ARIS. The terminology at ARIS uses &lsquo;Year\', such as a student in Year 6, in Year 9, or whatever.</p><p>The first point of reference for ARIS personnel handling admissions is the applicant student\'s current and/or previous school report(s). A judgement will be made as to the extent to which the report is authentic and a reliable basis for decisions.</p><p>If the child is age-appropriate for Years 7 &ndash; 9, s/he will sit, under examination conditions, a minimum of three entrance tests, in English Language (the medium of instruction in the school), Mathematics and Science respectively. Because the tests are security sensitive, there is no advance notice or other indication of their content.</p><p>The entrance tests are not centred on any one national educational system. To provide valid assessments of the academic attainment and potential of applicants from varied educational origins and educational backgrounds the content of the tests and the assessment instruments used are also varied; diverse in nature to reflect an international perspective and to ensure equity of access.</p><p>The entrance tests and the school report(s) inform the appropriate placement of new students and provide prospective teachers with a profile of the applicant\'s attainment in the relevant subject areas. The tests also function as a diagnostic instrument, highlighting anomalies and providing the basis of an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) compiled by the Special Educational Needs Coordinator. As the title indicates, the IEP is specific to the student. It directly addresses his or her academic needs, identifies &lsquo;SMART\' goals, appropriate teaching strategies to reach them, and a timeline for review.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission10-11\">Admission to Years 10 and 11 (IGCSE)</h3><p>The entrance tests and IEPs as described above are appropriate to applicants for Years 7 &ndash; 9 at any point in the academic year. External applicants, seeking entry to Year 10 at the start of the academic year, will sit tests in the subjects they plan to offer for the International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE), the courses spanning Years 10 and 11.</p><p>If after the commencement of the academic year an applicant is seeking admission to either Year 10 or 11, entrance tests are of necessity closely focused on the syllabus content of the desired courses. Because courses at IGCSE frequently involve optional content, perhaps unique syllabus choices and pedagogical interpretations made by individual teachers, there is much less flexibility in the admissions process, and transition from one school to another is potentially disruptive to the applicant\'s academic progress. The more time which has elapsed since the beginning of the IGCSE course, the more difficult it will be fully to meet the needs of the applicant. A lot of catch-up work may be required, or in extreme cases a subject may need to be abandoned altogether. The ARIS Faculty can be relied upon to do their utmost to resolve such problems in the best interests of the student.</p><p>Appropriate placement in an IGCSE (or IBDP) course can therefore only be achieved when the subject matter already covered by the applicant substantially matches that already covered in the course(s) to which s/he seeks admission. If there is not substantial overlap, bringing the new student into alignment with the progress already made by his or her peers, particularly in content-laden subjects, may be impossible. Subjects where greater emphasis is placed on skills rather than content may be less problematic.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission12\">Admission to Year 12 (IBDP)</h3><p>Admission of ARIS students to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is not automatic. Scheduled in March each year is the first phase of DP orientation for Year 11 students. It is designed to facilitate a clear understanding of the IBDP in general, and its interpretation, principles and practices at ARIS in particular.</p><p>Before addressing the individual circumstances of each student, the first phase of the IBDP orientation is predicated on the assumption that every student will be offering the full Diploma: the core of Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and the Extended Essay (EE), plus three Higher and three Standard Level subjects. Students\' preliminary subject choices will be similarly predicated, and similarly ambitious.</p><p>All students at IBDP level in ARIS will be expected to meet the Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) requirements and fully to participate in TOK classes. It is important that all students have a strong grasp of the underlying philosophy of the DP, and that whatever permutation of subjects they may offer, according to their individual circumstances and needs (perhaps a restricted range leading to certificates), they do not engage in their DP subjects in isolation, but have a sense of the holistic nature of the programme, its intention to educate the whole person, and its potential impact on their future lives.</p><p>The IBDP is academically rigorous. To be assured of a subject profile that enables eligibility for the award of the full Diploma, students should be seeking to attain at least six IGCSE subject passes at grade C or better, including English Language, a Science and Mathematics. For the three subjects to be taken at Higher Level, students should be seeking grades of B, A or A*.</p><p>A great many considerations, of course, must be taken into account in the construction of a DP subject profile appropriate to the individual student. The profile will accommodate as far as possible a recognition of the intelligences of the student, and his or her abilities, potentials and aspirations. And the process of constructing a profile extends beyond the empirically verifiable evidence of academic ability to less readily quantified attributes of the person, such as commitment, attitude, altruism and sense of responsibility to others. Attributes, perhaps, that mirror the IB Learner Profile, and which engagement with the DP will continue to cultivate.</p><p>ARIS is proud of the many ways support is provided to new students, particularly those facing language difficulties, and/or whose academic background (for whatever reason) signifies deficiencies in syllabus coverage or competencies in essential areas of the curriculum, such as mathematics and the sciences. The IEPs are devised and implemented to ensure that students experiencing these difficulties are soon able to match the progress of their peers.</p><p><em> &lsquo;Will this prospective student benefit from the educational programme available at ARIS?\' </em> That is the question which informs all decisions on admission.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>','','normal','admissions-policy',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2015-04-08 10:10:17',0,'dtoutoungi@aris.edu.gh'),(37,'Admissions Procedures',5,NULL,'<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/admissions-procedure.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Al Rayan International School is dedicated to serving international and local families.

The school requires that all documents are complete and all expected fees are paid in full before the student commences.</p><p>Admission is conditional upon parental agreement that students will participate fully in the curriculum and all related activities.

To the south of the campus is Kotoka International Airport (KIA), just a brief taxi ride away. The arrival of passenger planes from all over the world is not a disturbance to studious concentration, rather it is a perpetual reminder of people and places far distant. &nbsp;</p><p>There are two main structures on campus. The smaller building, fronting the entrance gate on the northern perimeter, houses the Administration and facilities for the Foundation Stage learners. These facilities include classrooms, restrooms and a baby-changing room.</p><p>The second, larger building is L-shaped, of two storeys, and includes the staff offices and Primary School classrooms. In this building there are altogether 22 rooms and four restrooms (two on each floor). On each side of the building there is a wide staircase from the ground floor to the first.</p><p>Other onsite facilities include the Science Lab, the Art room, a Library, Learning Support and Modern Foreign Language classrooms, and a bustling Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Lab.

The remaining 5% was represented by 11 other languages.<br />&bull; Second Language spoken at home: 34% identified Arabic as their second language, 33% English, 20% Hindi and 8% French. The remaining 5% was represented by 12 other languages.<br />&bull; Third Language spoken at home: 53% identified French as their 3rd language spoken at home, 20% Arabic, 10% Hindi and 8% English. The remaining 9% was represented by 11 other languages.<br />According to the above data, therefore, English is considered as the first language and mother tongue of 57% of ARIS students. Arabic is considered as the main second language along with Hindi, and French is considered as the main foreign language of ARIS students.</p><p>Language Philosophy at ARIS<br />The emphasis in language use at ARIS is intentionally on English, in order to facilitate learning in an English-medium curriculum and to enhance students&rsquo; academic career potential. It is recognised that the knowledge and acquisition of other languages not only promotes cognitive growth but is vital to social interactions, both formally and informally, inside and outside the classroom, at home and within the international community. <br />There is a strong link between learning a language and learning about a culture. It is therefore in the spirit of the ARIS mission statement and, more generally, the development of international mindedness, that students are encouraged to be proud of their own language and culture and, equally, learn a language other than their own.</p><p>Admission <br />A student&rsquo;s ability to access the curriculum and to succeed at ARIS is highly dependent on language proficiency. As part of the admissions process, new students undertake an English language assessment. Students whose level of English language is below a level that the school considers itself able to support with its English Language Support programmes may, in exceptional circumstances, be denied admission. Students who are deemed to require considerable English Language support will routinely be provided with additional English Language classes.</p><p>Language use in the classroom (with the exception of Modern Language classes):<br />The language of instruction is English and the curriculum is in the medium of English throughout the school, though it is recognised that other languages may be used for varying purposes during instructional activities. Decisions regarding language use in the classroom are at the discretion of individual teachers; however, it should always be kept in mind that becoming proficient in English is a priority in order to access English medium subject areas, such as the humanities and sciences, in the IGCSE and IB Diploma Programme curricula. Classroom teaching is thus guided by the following principles:<br />1. During general instructional activities, decisions regarding which language(s) should be used must be founded on the intention that all students develop the necessary language proficiency in English to perform to their best ability on all tasks related to the curriculum. <br />2. Notwithstanding (1), it may at times be helpful for students to think through or talk through unfamiliar or complex concepts in their first language before learning the vocabulary to talk about these concepts in English. <br />3. When whole class discussions or mixed-language group discussions / activities are taking place, it is important to use English in order to ensure the understanding of all participants. <br />4. Though the use of a student&rsquo;s first language is not discouraged in the school, there will often be times in the classroom where the teacher needs to stipulate that a particular activity be undertaken solely in English, in order to achieve the stated learning objectives. <br />5. Teachers should consider language use at all stages of curriculum planning and implementation, with the aim of facilitating student understanding of both the language used in the classroom and the concepts embedded in the curriculum. In support of this aim the school undertakes to provide on-going professional development for teachers in the area of ESL and EAL strategies appropriate for mainstream classroom settings.</p><p>Language use outside the classroom<br />In line with the general belief that diversity in the languages used by students and staff is a positive element reinforcing international-mindedness in the school, no language is discouraged outside the classroom. However, students are encouraged to communicate as appropriate with their peers in the common language of English. It is important that no student is excluded due to the prevalence of an unfamiliar language and that students do not experience a sense of alienation from others.<br />Overview of Language Programmes <br />English <br />Except in the obvious case of the Modern Language classes, English (in both written and spoken forms) is the medium of instruction.<br />English as the Medium of Instruction and Means of Communication<br />&bull; English is the language of instruction throughout ARIS.<br />&bull; In Primary and Secondary 1, all students study English as a first language, including those students requiring extra English language learning support. This support is provided through the English as an Additional Language (EAL) programme. <br />&bull; At IGCSE, students study English language as a first or second language. <br />&bull; In the Diploma Programme it is intended that all students pursue a course in English: English Language and Literature (HL or SL) or English Literature (HL or SL).</p><p>Courses Available<br />1. Years 1 to 9: All students follow the British National Curriculum and Cambridge Primary and Secondary 1 English courses which are based on recognised standards. These courses aim to develop the skills of reading, writing, listening, speaking, language foundations, and media literacy through engaging learning tasks using authentic contexts and assessments.<br />2. In Years 10 and 11, two courses are available: Cambridge IGCSE English as a First Language and English as a Second Language.<br />3. In Years 12 and 13, it is intended that students will follow the IB Diploma Programme English A Literature SL and HL.</p><p>English as an Additional Language<br />ARIS has a diverse school population. Our goal is to support the academic and social development of all students. The English as an Additional language (EAL) programme enables students whose first language or whose prior language of instruction is not English to develop their language skills. The purpose of the EAL services is to assist students to become proficient in English and to be able to study at year level. The EAL programme is offered in Years 1 to 11.<br />&bull; For a student to be identified as an EAL student, an assessment of his/her English language proficiency is carried out. Initial assessments will be typically conducted upon a student&rsquo;s first enrolment at ARIS, but may also be conducted at any point if there is an indication that there might be a need for EAL services.<br />&bull; Assessment of English language proficiency determines if the student&rsquo;s use of English is below the expected level. Support is provided for the student to adjust to the school culture and achieve year level expectations at ARIS.<br />&bull; Differentiated support is provided for each EAL student.<br />&bull; Progress in the acquisition of English is regularly reported to parents.<br />&bull; An EAL specialist plans and delivers the EAL services. Services may include individual or small group instruction, pull-out or push-in services.</p><p>Second Languages <br />Arabic <br />According to the data presented in the ARIS language profile, the majority of the students are Native and Heritage Arabic language learners who have been exposed to Arabic at their homes, who speak or merely understand Arabic, and who are, to various degrees, bilingual. Accordingly, Arabic is their second language. <br />&bull; In order to meet the needs of ARIS students, two Arabic programmes are offered:<br />1. Modern Standard Arabic programme (MSA) for Native and Heritage learners, and<br />2. Arabic as a Foreign Language programme (AFL) for non-native learners. <br />&bull; The Arabic curriculum is standard based, integrating the Cambridge IGCSE curriculum and the AERO+ World Languages standards.<br />&bull; Arabic is provided at all year levels. <br />o In Primary, Arabic is offered for one hour four times a week for all students. <br />o In Secondary 1, Arabic is offered three times a week for ninety minutes for all students.<br />o In the IGCSE Programme, Arabic courses comprise two 90 minute classes per week. <br />o In IBDP, it is planned that French B (HL/SL) and/or French Ab initio (SL) will be available for three 90 minute classes per week.<br />&bull; Enrolment in the Arabic programme: <br />o Incoming students wishing to join the Arabic programme will be placed in one of the above programmes depending on their background. As part of the admission procedure a placement test will be given to all incoming students to check their level of proficiency in Arabic. <br />o Students enrolled in Modern Standard Arabic, may not join AFL at any time as it is not designed for heritage learners. However, AFL students will be encouraged to stretch up to join MSA.<br />Placement in the AFL language courses depends on students&rsquo; background, proficiency level and availability of courses. In order to abide by the ethical considerations of the IB Diploma Programme, students will be placed in appropriate language courses in Year 12 based on their proficiency and background.</p><p>Hindi <br />According to the data presented in the ARIS language profile, the 20% of the students are Native and Heritage Hindi language learners who have been exposed to Hindi at their homes, who speak or merely understand Hindi, and who are, to various degrees, bilingual. Accordingly, Hindi is their second language. <br />&bull; The Hindi Curriculum is standard based integrating the AERO+ World languages Standards.<br />&bull; Hindi is provided mainly in Primary where it is offered for one hour four times a week.</p><p>French <br />French is available as a foreign language programme throughout the school.<br />&bull; The French curriculum is standards-based, integrating the Cambridge IGCSE curriculum and the AERO+ World Languages standards.<br />&bull; French is available as follows:<br />o In Years 1 and 2, French is offered twice a week. In Years 3 to 6, it is offered three times a week for all students (classes of 50 minutes duration).<br />o In Secondary 1, French is offered three times a week for students electing for the French Programme (90 minute classes).<br />o In IGCSE, French courses occupy two 90 minute classes a week.<br />o In IBDP, it is planned that French B (HL/SL) and/or French Ab initio (SL) will be available for three 90 minute classes per week.<br />Placement in the French language courses depends on the students&rsquo; background and proficiency level. All students entering the Secondary School, at all age levels will be given a placement test in the appropriate language(s) to assess their proficiency.</p><p>IB Diploma Programme: Placement in Language Acquisition Courses<br />The degree to which students are already competent in the language and the degree of proficiency they wish to attain by the end of the period of study are the most important factors in identifying the appropriate Language Acquisition course in Group 2. Even though a given course may initially seem very difficult it is essential that students follow the course that is best suited to their present and future needs and that will provide them with an appropriate academic opportunity and challenge.</p><p>&nbsp;Language Policy Review<br />This Language Policy is a working document which is reviewed annually by the Language Steering Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL,'normal','languages-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:27:56','2015-04-06 23:43:51',0,'ttrumper@aris.edu.gh'),(63,'Special Educational Needs Policy',15,NULL,'<p>Special Educational Needs Policy</p><p>ARIS is a Candidate School for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.</p>',NULL,'normal','special-educational-needs-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:28:32','2015-04-06 23:46:16',0,'ttrumper@aris.edu.gh'),(64,'Child Protection Policy',15,NULL,'<div class=\"outline\">\n	<h2>Document Outline</h2>\n	<ul>\n		<li>Preamble</li>\n		<ul>\n			<li>Application and Definitions</li>\n			<ul>\n				<li>Physical abuse</li>\n				<li>Emotional abuse</li>\n				<li>Neglect</li>\n				<li>Child Sexual Abuse</li>\n			</ul>\n			<li>Awareness</li>\n			<ul>\n				<li>Training and Development</li>\n			</ul>\n			<li>Prevention</li>\n			<ul>\n				<li>Vigilance in Recruitment and Selection</li>\n				<li>Police Checks</li>\n				<li>Code of Conduct</li>\n				<li>Use of Child Photos and Information</li>\n			</ul>\n			<li>Reporting</li>\n			<ul>\n				<li>Incident reporting</li>\n				<li>Document the incident</li>\n			</ul>\n			<li>Responding</li>\n			<ul>\n				<li>Distance the alleged perpetrator</li>\n				<li>Confidentiality </li>\n				<li>Reprisal </li>\n				<li>Counseling support </li>\n				<li>Investigation of complaints </li>\n			</ul>\n			<li>Review of this Policy</li>\n		</ul>\n	</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Preamble</h2>\n\n<p>This policy statement affirms ARIS’s commitment to the welfare of children and their protection from abuse, exploitation and neglect.</p>\n<p>Consistent with ARIS’s vision, mission and core values of respect, integrity and accountability, we seek to create and maintain a school environment that is free of harassment and exploitation, and to ensure the same in all of our work with the students and communities that we work with.</p> \n\n<p>ARIS is committed to having child-safe school. </p>\n\n<h3>Application and Definitions</h3>\n\n<p>For the purpose of this policy, a child will be considered to be a person under the age of 18 years. </p>\n\n<p>The policy applies to:</p> \n\n<ul> \n	<li>all staff </li>\n	<li>all contractors, e.g., consultants </li>\n	<li>all volunteers and interns </li>\n	<li>all Board members </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Child abuse can be physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect or sexual abuse. </p>\n\n<h4>Physical abuse</h4>\n\n<p>Physical abuse occurs when a person purposefully injures or threatens to injure a child or young person. This may take the form of slapping, pinching, punching, shaking, kicking, burning, shoving or grabbing. The injury may take the form of bruises, cuts, burns or fractures.</p>\n\n<h4>Emotional abuse</h4>\n	<p>Emotional abuse is a chronic attack on a child or young person\'s self esteem. It can take the form of name calling, threatening, ridiculing, intimidating or isolating the child or young person. </p>\n<h4>Neglect</h4>\n	<p>Neglect is the failure to provide the child with the basic necessities of life (where such necessities are available), such as food, clothing, shelter and supervision to the extent that the child\'s health and development are at risk.</p>\n<h4>Child Sexual Abuse</h4>\n	<p>Sexual abuse is when a child or young person is used by an older or bigger child, adolescent or adult for his or her own sexual stimulation or gratification, or economic gain.</p>\n\n<h3>Awareness</h3>\n\n	<p>ARIS will ensure that all staff and others are aware of the problem of child abuse and the risks to children.</p>\n\n<h4>Training and Development </h4>\n	<p>All staff will receive information relating to ARIS’ Child Protection Policy during the induction process. Further training will be provided during INSET training for staff.</p>\n\n<h3>Prevention</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that through awareness and personal and professional conduct, that staff and others minimize the risk to children.</p>\n\n<h4>Vigilance in Recruitment and Selection</h4>\n<p>The Human Resources team and Administration Office adhere by strict guidelines in the recruiting process of new staff, consultants, volunteers and interns. The recruitment guidelines will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that they accurately reflect child safe recruiting and screening standards. The recruitment guidelines will include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A clear and bold statement that confirms ARIS’s commitment to child protection in all contracts </li>\n<li>Adopting ‘best practice’ recruitment and selection techniques </li>\n<li>Conducting reference checks </li>\n<li>Conducting police checks where required and feasible </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Police Checks</h4>\n\n<p>All personnel who work with children will be asked to sign an authority for a police check. In addition, police checks will be conducted for all full-time, part-time and long-term contract employees, regardless of whether or not they work with children.</p> \n<p>In cases where international and national criminal record checks cannot be completed in time or where a country does not provide criminal record checks with adequate reliability, rigorous referee checks will be used in its place. </p>\n\n\n<h4>Code of Conduct</h4>\n\n<p>All staff, consultants and volunteers will be expected to sign and adhere to a Code of Conduct for the Protection of the Child</p>\n\n<h4>Use of Child Photos and Information</h4>\n\n<p>Pictures, images, or other likenesses of children and/or information related to children that could compromise their care and protection will not be made available through any form of communication media without proper protection and understanding of their use. Moreover, any images of children should not be accompanied by detailed information.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that staff and others are clear about what steps to take where concerns arise regarding the safety of children.</p>\n\n<h4>Incident reporting</h4>\n<p>It is mandatory for any allegation, belief or suspicion of sexual or physical abuse (past or present) by an ARIS employee, sponsor, donor, board member or other partner to be reported immediately to the Child Protection Officer or the Principal Office. </p>\n<p>If a child reports an incident, the child/young person must be taken seriously and listened to carefully. Once an allegation is made there should be an immediate response that protects the child from further potential abuse or victimization. Where appropriate, the family of the child victim should be informed of the allegation and action proposed and they should be consulted where possible as to the process to be followed. This process will be steered and guided by the Child Protection Officer and Principal.</p>\n<p>Al-Rayaan International School has a Child Protection reporting procedure that takes into account the local context of Ghana and the culture of the child involved.</p> \n\n<h4>Document the incident</h4>\n\n<p>As soon as possible (within a period of 24 hours of the disclosure), the staff member receiving the disclosure needs to have fully documented the allegation, including the time, place, witnesses. This report will possibly be used in court if charges are forthcoming. </p>\n<p>All reports should be submitted to the Child protection officer who will discuss the case with the Principal and the School Executive Board.</p> \n<p>If any staff member is alleged to have committed or been arrested for, or convicted of, criminal offences relating to child abuse then the staff’s contract will be immediately terminated and the case transferred to the school’s Disciplinary Committee.</p> \n<p>If the incident occurs in Ghana or involves a Ghanaian, the Executive Board will consult with legal counsel and all appropriate bodies (e.g., Police, Department of Family and Community Services, Human Services…), to ascertain due process and steer participants accordingly, subject to the incident reported.</p> \n<p>If the incidence involves an international staff (non-Ghanaian), then the appropriate embassies and bodies (Police, Immigration…) will also be contacted and consulted.</p>\n\n<h3>Responding</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that action is taken to support and protect children where concerns arise regarding possible abuse. </p>\n<h4>Distance the alleged perpetrator </h4>\n<p>The best interests of the child/young person may warrant the standing down of a staff member, consultant or volunteer while an investigation commences. Staff members stood down receive full pay and are entitled to a just process that does not pre-suppose guilt or innocence. The allegations should not be discussed or communicated to other people until such have been considered and a decision made by the school’s Disciplinary Committee. The decision made should be documented and filed.</p>\n<h4>Confidentiality </h4>\n<p>Confidentiality is crucial to a fair and effective reporting procedure. It is unacceptable and potentially defamatory for concerns of child abuse (and abusers) to be spread throughout the school body rather than being directed through a formal complaints process. All participants must understand the importance of following the set reporting lines when concerns arise. Confidentiality protects the child, the notifier, the respondent and the school, and ensures a fair and proper process.</p>\n\n<h4>Reprisal </h4>\n<p>ARIS will not tolerate any form of coercion, intimidation, reprisal or retaliation against any employee who reports any form of abuse or exploitation, provides any information or other assistance in an investigation. </p>\n<h4>Counseling support </h4>\n<p>Professional counseling support will be made available to all parties involved.</p>\n<h4>Investigation of complaints </h4>\n<p>Physical and/or sexual abuse of a child is a crime. ARIS may be required to notify authorities when there are reasonable grounds for reporting abuse, particularly if the allegations are made in Ghana or involve a Ghanaian citizen.  Allegations involving international staff and students will need to consider international and national legislation and procedures to investigate and address the allegations. ARIS will work closely with relevant Embassies and governments to resolve such allegations.  It is important to note that consideration should be given to how the local authorities will treat the alleged perpetrator (eg., torture, death penalty, corrupt justice systems) as well as the child (eg., will the child be victimised, criminalised or forced to undergo medical checks).</p>\n<p>Internal investigations will consider a confidential, thorough, impartial and prompt process.

Our educational programme in the Primary school is solidly based on the assumption that pupils will attend school regularly, in accordance with the School calendar and the daily schedule. Regular attendance is compulsory in order to fulfil the requirements and assignments in all subjects. Erratic attendance will inevitably impede the rate of progress, limit the student&rsquo;s potential achievements and negatively affect his or her academic record. The student must be in class to progress.</p><p>Furthermore, if any student(s) is/are absent it potentially disrupts the learning and success of others. The absentee may, for instance, be involved in a collaborative or group project, where progress of a number of other students may be negatively affected. The grades of students who conscientiously attend school may suffer as a consequence of the erratic attendance of their less conscientious classmates.</p><p>In addition, the teacher, whose time, obviously, is finite, may be obliged to divert his or her attention from whole-class activities/learning to attend to the absentee&rsquo;s knowledge gaps and bring him or her &lsquo;up to speed.&rsquo; Simply because of one student&rsquo;s casual attitude.</p><p>Regular, punctual attendance is therefore non-negotiable and required of every pupil.</p><h4>Purpose of the Attendance Policy</h4><p>It is intended that this policy, the implementation of which involves a collaborative effort on the part of the entire school community, that is students, parents, staff and the Board, gives clear, practical guidance as to the means of monitoring, maintaining and if necessary improving the levels of attendance expected, without exception, of every student.</p><p>The Attendance Policy has been designed to ensure:</p><ul><li>that all members of the school community are clearly aware of their responsibilities</li><li>consistency and coherence of class teaching, thus enabling all students to achieve outstanding levels of achievement, progress and personal growth.</li></ul><h4>Absences</h4><p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency. Parents may excuse their children from school for such reasons, but ARIS may at its own discretion not honour parent-signed excuses on other pretexts. Because of the inevitable toll on academic progress in particular, the school seeks willing co-operation from parents in exercising the utmost restraint in excusing their children from school.</p><h5>Authorised/Excused Absences</h5><p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of essential documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved in advance by the Principal. <strong>If at all possible, medical/dental appointments during school hours must be avoided.</strong></p><h5>Unauthorised/Unexcused Absences</h5><p>Unexcused absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Principal. Work missed for such absences must be completed. Unexcused absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p><h4>Truancy</h4><p>Truancy is considered to be a student missing part or all of the school day without parental and the school\'s permission, and is treated as very serious offence. Leaving campus without permission during the school day constitutes truancy. Not least because of safety and security considerations, the school will immediately attempt to contact the parents if the student is inexplicably absent.</p><p>Obviously, truancy has a deleterious effect on the student\'s educational progress. The Head of Primary is responsible for dealing with truancy and the consequences thereof. Disciplinary action may entail up to three days suspension, which will remain permanently on the student&rsquo;s record.</p><h4>Consequences of Unexcused Absences</h4><p>Because tertiary institutions responsible for the next phase of any student&rsquo;s education will require evidence, the record of attendance routinely becomes a permanent entry on a student&rsquo;s file. It is also a requirement under the laws of Ghana.</p><p>If poor attendance persists, it may be necessary to have the student repeat all or part of the school year, or to request that the parents withdraw the student from the school.</p><p>A student absent for six days or more (excused or unexcused) during the term will receive formal acknowledgement of school attendance only upon review of the circumstances of the absences and the final level of achievement in work undertaken.</p><p>Compensation (make-up) for extended absences for medical reasons should be arranged through the Class teacher in consultation with the Head of Primary. Pupils are responsible for making up all missed work, whether or not an absence was excused.</p><p>The Faculty will make reasonable efforts to assist students in making up school work for excused absences, but will also be mindful, as stated previously, that in doing so their attention may be diverted from the needs of the majority of students in the class. Students absent on the day of an assessment are expected to make up the assessment on return to school.</p><h3>Procedures</h3><h4>Responsibility</h4><p>The Head of Primary is responsible for setting and overseeing attendance procedures, and for ensuring that:</p><ul><li>attendance is checked and reported daily</li><li>a daily record of attendance is maintained and logged, and</li><li>written explanations are submitted by parents for all absences</li></ul><h4>Registration Procedure</h4><p>Registration of student attendance is a national, legal requirement.</p><p>Registration of student attendance is taken by the Class Teachers at 08.00. The Attendance Registers are closed at 08.05.</p><p>Students must always bring a note from parents/guardians explaining an absence. This must be given to the Class Teacher at registration on the first day of return to school.</p><h4>Late Arrivals</h4><p>If students arrive to class after the Register has been closed at 08.05, they will be recorded as &lsquo;Late&rsquo;. Three &lsquo;Latenesses&rsquo; equate to one full day&rsquo;s absence. A cumulative record of absences will be maintained on file.</p><p>Students who arrive after 08.00 must report directly to the Reception Desk and sign the Late Book, entering their time of arrival and the explanation for their being late. They will be given a Late Pass by the Receptionist. When the student arrives at the lesson with a Late Pass, s/he must submit it to the teacher, who will decide if and when the student will be admitted to the class.</p><h4>Non-Attendance</h4><p>In the event of illness or other unforeseen absence, parents are requested to call Reception and report the student&rsquo;s absence by 07.45 latest. They should then follow-up with an explanatory note on the student&rsquo;s return to class. When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a form for the duration of the planned absence and return it to their Class Teacher.</p><p>The absence will be classified as unexcused until an adequate explanation is received. Parents should notify Reception each day of the absence, unless the Head of Primary has been notified of a prolonged absence in advance.</p><h4>Follow-up Procedures</h4><p>The following time quota apply from the start of any one academic year.</p><ul><li>Parents will be contacted by the ARIS Administrator when the student has reached six days of unexcused absence.</li><li>Parents will be informed in writing by the ARIS Administrator when the student has reached 12 days of unexcused absence.</li><li>A final telephone call will be made by the ARIS Administrator to parents when the student has reached 16 days of unexcused absence.</li><li>When the student has been absent for 18 days, the parents will receive notification in writing that the student will not be allowed to return to school the following year.</li><li>If a student is absent for more than 30 days, s/he will not be able to return to school without the approval of the Board.</li></ul><h4>Appointments during the Day</h4><p>Students may only leave during the school day if collected by a designated responsible adult and 24 hours&rsquo; prior notice has been given to the Class Teacher. The responsible adult must first report to Reception and the pupil will be sent to the Reception to be collected.</p></div><div class=\"tab_section\" data-section=\"secondary\"><h3>Secondary School Attendance Policy</h3><p>ARIS is a Candidate School for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>The ARIS educational programme in the Secondary School is solidly based on the assumption that students will attend school regularly, in accordance with the published School Calendar and the daily schedule. Regular class attendance is a must for fulfilling the many requirements and assignments in all subjects, and for completing each course of study satisfactorily. Erratic attendance will inevitably impede the rate of progress, limit the student&rsquo;s potential achievements and negatively affect his or her academic record. Permanently.</p><p>It should be self-evident that students learn through participation in class; they learn through interaction with the teacher, with their peers, through discussion, tests, quizzes, written work and examinations. The student, therefore, must be in class to progress. The classroom (or Science Lab, or Library or Multimedia Resource Centre, for example) is the focus of the learning dynamic and being a part of that dynamic is absolutely essential.</p><p>Furthermore, if any student(s) is/are absent it potentially disrupts the learning and success of others. The absentee may, for instance, be involved in a collaborative or group project, where progress of a number of other students may be negatively affected. The grades of students who conscientiously attend school may suffer as a consequence of the erratic attendance of their less conscientious classmates. There are no inbuilt compensatory mechanisms to prevent this happening, and it may even negatively impact examination results at IGCSE and Diploma Programme level.</p><p>Or the teacher, whose time, obviously, is finite, may be obliged to divert his or her attention from whole-class activities/learning to attend to the absentee&rsquo;s knowledge gaps and bring him or her &lsquo;up to speed.&rsquo; Simply because of one student&rsquo;s casual attitude.</p><p>Regular, punctual attendance is therefore non-negotiable and required of every student.</p><h4>Purpose of the Attendance Policy</h4><p>It is intended that this policy, the implementation of which involves a collaborative effort on the part of the entire school community, that is students, parents, staff and the Board, gives clear, practical guidance as to the means of monitoring, maintaining and if necessary improving the levels of attendance expected, without exception, of every student.</p><p>The Attendance Policy has been designed to ensure:</p><ul><li>that all members of the school community are clearly aware of their responsibilities</li><li>consistency and coherence of class teaching, thus enabling all students to achieve outstanding levels of achievement, progress and personal growth.</li></ul><h4>Absences</h4><p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency.

It should be our responsibility to inculcate these values of honesty and integrity in our students from an early age and to do our best to ensure that these values last.</p><p>This policy document, focused on Academic Honesty, is intended to be concise, and stems from, and is coherent with, the school&rsquo;s commitment to academic honesty and integrity. Academic honesty is a fundamental tenet of the ARIS philosophy and accordingly is integral to the life-long values which ARIS aims to inculcate in its students, from Primary Years to the Diploma Programme.</p><p>A prior assumption is that ARIS students and teachers are honest by nature, proud of that, and wish to remain so. An important educational aim for ARIS teachers, however, is to reinforce that innate honesty and thus enable students to derive satisfaction from their own accomplishments, secure in the knowledge that their accomplishments are indeed their own.</p><p>Academic honesty should be seen as a set of values, reinforced by skills that promote personal integrity and good practice in teaching, learning and assessment. Academic honesty is influenced and shaped by a variety of factors including peer pressure, culture, parental expectations, role- modelling and taught skills. Academic dishonesty may stem from similar origins: your classmates are getting away with it, why shouldn\'t you? Your own culture respects emulation of those recognised as the finest practitioners. Therefore copy the best. If you fail, you fail your family. And so on.</p><p>It is argued here that although it is easier to explain to students what constitutes academic dishonesty, with direct reference to examples of plagiarism, collusion and cheating in exams, whenever possible the topic should be treated by teachers in a positive way, stressing the educational benefits which accrue when, for example, academic research is properly conducted, when the temptation to take shortcuts is resisted, and when the borrowing or outright theft of someone else\'s ideas and presenting them as one\'s own is seen as reprehensible.</p><p>This policy document includes:</p><ul><li>possible definitions of what constitutes academic dishonesty, malpractice, plagiarism and intellectual property</li><li>an account of the consequences of academic dishonesty at ARIS and the suggested consequences that will occur if a student is found guilty</li><li>examples of conventions for citing and acknowledging original authorship</li><li>guidance on the distinction between legitimate collaboration and unacceptable collusion (different from collaboration) or plagiarism.</li></ul><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"academicdishonestyandmalpractice\">ACADEMIC DISHONESTY AND MALPRACTICE</h2><h3>Definition of terms</h3><p>The IBO regulations, for example, define malpractice as behaviour that results in, or may result in, the student gaining an unfair advantage (relative to other students) in one or more assessment components. Malpractice includes:</p><ul><li><strong>plagiarism:</strong> this is defined as the representation of the ideas or work of another person as the student\'s own</li><li><strong>collusion:</strong> this is defined as supporting malpractice by another student, as in allowing one&rsquo;s work to be copied or submitted for assessment by another</li><li><strong>duplication</strong> of work: this is defined as the presentation of the same work for different subjects, assessment components and/or requirements</li><li>the taking of unauthorised material into an examination room, or disrupting an examination</li><li><strong>any other behaviour that gains an unfair advantage</strong> for a student or that affects the results of another student.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that malpractice, unfortunately, is not confined to offences by students.</p><p>The intellectual property of others may also be misused. Intellectual property is property that is the result of creativity. It does not exist in tangible, legal form, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks et cetera, but is nevertheless the product of another person\'s work. Examples include a variety of sources (CD-ROMs, DVDs, photographs, illustrations, art works, music and data) in addition to journals, books and web sites.</p><p>Students and teachers must be aware that the requirement to acknowledge sources extends beyond text taken from the Internet, CD-ROMs, books, magazines and journals. The concepts of intellectual property and academic honesty include, for example, the use of footnotes or endnotes to acknowledge the source of an idea if that idea emerged as a result of discussion with, or listening to, a fellow student, a teacher or any other person.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"consequences\">THE CONSEQUENCES OF MALPRACTICE</h2><p>While ARIS does its utmost to develop in students the highest ethical standards in academic work, there may arise occasions when those standards are breached. The table overleaf is intended to provide examples of breaches of academic honesty, in various contexts, and their recommended consequences. It is not exhaustive. A basic premise is that academic dishonesty is a gross breach of the educational values which ARIS attempts to inculcate; therefore all proven cases of academic dishonesty should be:</p><ul><li>followed by the stated disciplinary action (consequence)</li><li>permanently documented in the student\'s file</li><li>reported in writing to the parents/guardians.</li></ul><p>In spite of what was stated on the first page of this paper, ie that malpractice entails a deliberate attempt to gain academic advantage, it will almost invariably be difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the attempt to gain academic advantage was intentional. Hence, should evidence of intention to deceive be uncovered, or should the intention be admitted by the suspect, it should not be held as key to the proof of malpractice, rather, it should be considered as corroboratory. The \' key to the proof of malpractice\' is the documentary or other evidence.</p><p>Investigations of suspicions of academic dishonesty should be conducted in a heuristic, rather than an inquisitorial, confrontational or adversarial style. The aim of an investigation should be to discover the truth of the matter, rather than to intimidate or threaten the student suspected. The student should be entitled to have a witness or a trusted teacher present if s/he so chooses. Not, however, a parent, guardian or lawyer whose independence of judgement may be compromised.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"typesof\">TYPES OF MALPRACTICE &amp; CONTEXT / SUGGESTED CONSEQUENCES</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Offence<sup>1</sup></th><th>Context<sup>2</sup></th><th>Suggested Consequence</th></tr><tr><td>plagiarism</td><td>Homework/class tests</td><td>Disciplinary action as appropriate, mark of zero awarded and loss of grade.

Notification to the IBO of proven instances of malpractice is the responsibility of the IBDP Coordinator.</li></ol><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"detection\">The detection of plagiarism</h3><p>It is the ARIS student who should be ultimately responsible for ensuring that all work submitted for assessment is authentic, not the teacher or the EE supervisor (though of course they have a major responsibility). The work or ideas of others must be fully and correctly cited and acknowledged. Students should be expected to review their own work before submission for assessment to identify any passages, data, graphs, photographs, computer programmes and so on that still require acknowledgment.</p><p>The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, published in August 2014 and available on the OCC, provides useful guidance as to why, when, what and how to cite source materials. Teachers should familiarise students with the content of this document when appropriate.</p><p>When reading students\' work teachers should be vigilant for obvious changes in the style of writing. Equally significant is a style that seems too mature, too error free and perhaps more characteristic of an experienced academic than a secondary school student. Evidence of copying and pasting may immediately be obvious from inconsistent fonts and/or kerning.</p><p>Over the period of the courses in the Primary and Secondary Schools teachers will, or at least should, become very familiar with the style and quality of each student\'s work in their classes. It is therefore the teachers who are in the best position to identify work that may not be authentic, and if the student knows the teacher is vigilant, s/he may be less tempted to resort to plagiarism in times of stress or crisis. If such stresses or crises occur, the student should be encouraged to seek the solace of the Guidance Counsellor. Malpractice, whether detected or not, will only exacerbate emotional stress.</p><p>Although in most cases of plagiarism that come to the attention of the Examining Boards the candidate has copied passages from a web site, there is still frequent plagiarism from books and journals, in addition to the illicit use of photographs, graphs, data and computer programmes from a variety of sources. In many cases it is likely that the teacher is familiar with the books being used by candidates; they may be standard textbooks for the subject, or books that are readily available in the school library. The author of this paper knows of one instance where the teacher himself was the author of the work plagiarised.</p><p>The teacher must be alert for familiar passages or fragments of passages loosely assembled, perhaps without grammatical or ideational coherence. If necessary, the teacher should check that such passages have not been copied from elsewhere. In the first instance, a mere chat with the student about the content of the suspect work may reveal that the student has only a superficial understanding of what s/he has written.</p><p>To be introduced to the Theory of Knowledge assessment for the May 2015 examination session, but not yet available at the time of writing (October 2014) is a requirement that in the course of the students&rsquo; preparation of the essay on a Prescribed Title teachers conduct several &lsquo;interactions&rsquo; with the student author. This is to ensure that the essay has guided by an appropriate level of professional input from the designated teacher and/or class discussions, and not by an internet mentor (a euphemism for someone paid to write the essay on behalf of the student). It could be argued that, had TOK teachers collectively been more vigilant in the prevention of plagiarism, such draconian counter-measures at the strategic level would never have been necessary.</p><p>In the IBDP, at least, assessment is an integral element of the curriculum. Academic malpractice at times appears to be driving assessment development regressively, in directions less and less conducive to the optimal teaching and learning context.</p><p>With the growth of the Internet and corresponding increase in its use, the abuse of electronic media is now, sadly, prevalent within the academic community. Aside from the immense number of legitimate websites, there are an increasing number of sites that actively encourage students to plagiarise and purchase essays, such as the TOK one mentioned. Little can be done to prevent the emergence of these sites, but the Internet can also be used for detecting academic dishonesty. Several of the more efficient search engines can be used to detect the source of passages that have been plagiarised, although with the exponential growth in the quantity of stored data this is becoming less and less feasible.</p><p>There are several websites that offer a useful service in detecting plagiarism from the Internet, for example, http://turnitin.com to which ARIS may decide to maintain a subscription. Again, however, it must be stressed that software of this kind can easily be circumvented; there is no substitute for the teachers&rsquo; vigilance. The discussions among teachers new to this type of software often indicate that the teachers have not themselves internalised the ability to differentiate qualitatively between examples of plagiarised and examples of authentic student work. They are reliant instead on seemingly authoritative, computer-generated indicators of &lsquo;percentage copied&rsquo;, prettily colour coded; indicators which may be themselves be based on spurious data. It is important that ARIS teachers develop, over time, the ability to identify atypical work.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"authenticating\">Authenticating candidates&rsquo; work</h3><p>It is the responsibility of teachers to support students in the preparation of their work for assessment and to ensure that all student work complies with the requirements of the relevant curriculum guidelines. Therefore, teachers (or supervisors in the case of IB Extended Essays) are in by far the best position to judge whether a candidate&rsquo;s work is authentic. Ongoing support and guidance will help with the early detection of unintentional plagiarism and will dissuade students from deliberate plagiarism because they know their work is regularly subject to scrutiny. However, what is realistic and what can be achieved within the usual constraints of time and workload must be left to the discretion of teachers and the relevant coordinator.</p><p>As previously stated, the candidates are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the final version of any work is authentic. Candidates themselves must bear the consequences if they submit any work for assessment that is not their own, regardless of whether the plagiarism was unintentional or deliberate. The same principle applies to collusion.</p><p>If the coordinator and/or a teacher has reason to believe that part or the whole of a candidate&rsquo;s draft work submitted for discussion prior to final submission might be deemed to be in violation of the principles of academic honesty and constitutes a case of malpractice, they must draw the candidate&rsquo;s attention to this risk and to her/his duty to respect the policy and requirements of academic honesty.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"bibliographies\">Bibliographies, references and citations</h3><p>All work submitted for assessment must reflect intellectual honesty in research practices and provide the reader with the exact sources of quotations, ideas and points of view through accurate bibliographies and referencing. The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, (mentioned on page 4) is a useful resource for both students and teacher.</p><p>Producing accurate citations, referencing and a bibliography is a skill that students should be seeking to perfect. Documenting the research in this way is vital: it allows readers to evaluate the evidence for themselves and it shows the student&rsquo;s understanding of the importance of the sources used.</p><p><em>Failure to comply with this requirement will be viewed as plagiarism and will, therefore, be treated as a case of malpractice</em>.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisb\">What is a bibliography?</h3><p>A bibliography is an alphabetical list of every source used. Sources that are not cited in the body of the piece of work, but were important in informing the approach taken, should be cited in the introduction or in an acknowledgment. The bibliography should list only those sources cited. Examiners will not be impressed by a long and stylish list that bears little or no connection with the text of the piece of work. Rather, such a list may remind the examiner of the extent of the resources spurned by the student.</p><p>There are a number of different documentation styles available for use when writing research papers at IBDP level; most are appropriate in some academic disciplines but not others. The IB does not mandate use of a particular style, rather that just one be used and presented consistently, and above all, when used as a reference (see below), enables the reader (examiner) to trace the source. If the bibliographical item cannot be accessed on the basis of the information provided, or, if it was transient, contain evidence that it once existed, the information might as well not be there.</p><p>The teacher should help students decide on a citation style for the particular piece of work set. It is important to remember that, whatever style is chosen, it must be simple to use and must be applied consistently. When choosing the style, the student needs to have a clear understanding of how it is to be used before embarking on the work. The style should be applied at all stages in the production of the piece of work. This is good practice, not only for producing a high-quality final product, but also for reducing the opportunities and temptation to plagiarise.</p><p>Finding information about citation/documentation styles is not difficult. Entering a string, such as \'academic referencing\', into an Internet search engine will bring up lots of useful material. Or the student can simply copy the style (not the content) shown in the main textbook used in researching the topic s/he is writing about. That will not be construed as plagiarism!</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisr\">What is a reference?</h3><p>A reference is a way of indicating to the reader, in an orderly and systematic form, where information has been obtained. A reference provides all the information needed to find/trace the source material. References must be included because they acknowledge the sources used, and enable the reader to trace and consult the source work and verify the data that has been presented. If the reference does not enable the reader to trace and consult the source work, then it is useless.</p><p>References must be given whenever someone else&rsquo;s work is quoted or summarized. References can come from many different sources, including books, magazines, journals, newspapers, e-mails, Internet sites and interviews. Internet references should include the title of the extract used as well as the web site address, the date it was accessed and, if possible, its author.</p><p>Caution should be exercised with information on web sites that do not give references or that cannot be cross-checked against other sources. The more important a particular point is to the essay, the more the quality of its source needs to be evaluated. And if a particular source is alluded to time and time again, is reliability and authenticity is all the more important. As a TOK student will know, frequency of reference, which is one of the factors which propel a website to prominence in a web search, is just one test of truth.</p><p>Any references to interviews (transient) should state the name of the interviewer, the name of the interviewee, the date and the place of the interview.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisc\">What is a citation?</h3><p>A citation is a shorthand method of making a reference in the body of an essay, which is then linked to the full reference at the end of the essay. A citation provides the reader with accurate references so that s/he can locate the source easily. How sources are cited varies with the particular documentation style that has been chosen. Page numbers should normally be given when referencing printed material: in some styles this will be in the citation, in others in the full reference. Once again, it is important to emphasise that there must be consistency of method when citing sources. This is not important from the point of view of stylistic elegance, but to facilitate traceability of sources by the examiner/moderator.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"notes\">Author&rsquo;s note</h3><p>Finally, this policy document was written in connection with and compiled from the publications listed below and, in fulfilment of the advice therein, and the corresponding advice given in this paper, acknowledges extensive use of the IBO material.</p><p><em>Academic Honesty: Guidance for Schools</em> (September 2003), IBO</p><p><em>Academic Honesty: Diploma Programme</em> (September 2007), IBO</p><p><em>Extended Essay: Guide</em> (March 2007), IBO</p><p><em>Academic Honesty in the IB Educational Context</em> (August 2014), IBO</p><p><em>Effective Citing and Referencing</em> (August 2014), IBO</p><p>Trevor Trumper, Diploma Programme Coordinator<br /> Al-Rayan International School, Ghana</p>',NULL,'normal','academic-honesty-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:31:54','2015-04-06 23:49:35',0,'ttrumper@aris.edu.gh'),(68,'Assessment Policy',15,NULL,'<p>Assessment Policy</p><p>ARIS is a Candidate School for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />The purpose of this statement of policy is to provide broad guidance on assessment in the Secondary School at ARIS, which more specific departmental policies can interpret, articulate and implement. <br />The assessment policy and procedures at departmental level will vary according to the relevant programme and subject followed, and in general are defined by the external examining body responsible for the curriculum at that student age level:<br />&bull; Cambridge Checkpoint for Key Stage 3, corresponding to Years 7, 8 and 9 <br />&bull; International General Certificate of Secondary Education, corresponding to Years 10 and 11, and <br />&bull; International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, corresponding to Years 12 and 13.<br />Woven into in each level are well-defined accounts of the nature of the assessments, the assessment instruments (examination components) to be used, the assessment objectives (AOs), the assessment criteria and descriptors, and the scheme of mensuration by which student performance is calibrated. Both criterion-specific and component-specific grade band descriptors are augmented by series of grade descriptors providing a statement of the attributes or characteristics of a student\'s achievement at each grade level in the subject as a whole. For example, the work of a student with a grade B in IGCSE Additional Maths will exhibit \'x, y z\' characteristics. The entire territory is clearly mapped and serves as an essential reference for both students and teachers.<br />The above curricula comprise the majority of the subjects taught at ARIS. Accordingly, our teachers are trained in and required to comply with the concomitant assessment rubrics. The parameters of such assessments are therefore prescribed by external agencies (eg Cambridge International Examinations, the International Baccalaureate Organization). The prescription, however, invites useful questions.</p><p><strong>What is assessment?</strong><br />We may begin by asking ourselves what educational assessment is in general. Obviously, in its broadest sense, assessment is a fundamental part of the educational process. Assessment is going on continuously in a school such as ARIS &ndash; not only formal assessment in the form of marks, grades and comments being attached in some documented form to pieces of student work, but also in a more informal manner at every level of interaction between student and teacher. The basic process of getting to know students and achieving a general understanding of their quality of learning could justifiably be included here. More specifically, however, the course of a lesson may spontaneously change as a result of the teacher&rsquo;s awareness of the level of comprehension of the students &ndash; this is also a process in which assessment is playing a crucial, if subliminal, role.</p><p><strong>What are the aims of assessment?</strong></p><p>Assessment in our Secondary School is important for a number of reasons. These include:</p><ul><li>Providing a clear statement for all interested parties of the level of achievement reached by a student by a certain stage of the educational process</li><li>Acting as a diagnostic tool for teachers to plan subsequent learning experiences in the light of the student&rsquo;s current level of understanding</li><li>Acting as feedback so that the student obtains realistic information about current achievement and his or her degree of progress</li><li>Contributing to the accountability of the school towards parents and guardians.</li></ul><p>Although the boundary between them is not really sharp, it can be useful at this early point to distinguish between two broad types of assessment that are different in terms of their aims:</p><ul><li>Formative assessment provides detailed feedback to students and teachers on the nature of strengths and weaknesses, and capabilities; focused on support for learning and the potential of the student; sometimes referred to as assessment <em>for</em> learning</li><li>Summative assessment comprises information about student achievement and supports teacher and school accountability; sometimes referred to as assessment <em>of&nbsp;</em>learning.</li></ul><p>The IBO Guidelines state that:</p><p>\'Formative assessment represents the process of gathering, analysing, interpreting and using the evidence to improve student learning and to help students to achieve their potential. It is one essential component of classroom practice and needs to be integrated into the curriculum. The assessment policy will make clear to the whole community what the expectations and practices relating to formative assessment in the school are [whereas]</p><p>Summative assessment is concerned with measuring student performance against Diploma Programme assessment criteria to judge levels of attainment. Teachers must be aware of the principles and practices that the IB uses to conduct summative assessment. Summative and formative assessments are, therefore, inherently linked and teachers must use their knowledge of IB summative assessment expectations and practices to help students improve performance in a formative way.\'</p><p>(Source: Guidelines for developing a school assessment policy in the Diploma Programme, pub. IBO, 2010)</p><p><strong>Interpreting the rubrics</strong><br />It is intended that teachers will be able to design and implement assessment tasks that are consistent with the aims stated above. This document should also serve to standardize the understanding of the nature of assessment across the wider school community, depending on the degree of consensus in the responses to the questions raised.</p><p><strong>Reflections on assessment</strong><br />&bull; Why are we assessing? What is our rationale or intention? Are we assessing to gain information or knowledge? To what use will we be putting such information or knowledge? For whom are we assessing? Ourselves? The students? Third parties? Parents? Employers? Universities? <br />&bull; To what extent, if any, should the identity of the recipient of the assessment outcome affect how the assessment is conducted, and/or what is communicated?<br />&bull; Which of our own Ways of Knowing do we use in trying to find out what ARIS students know and can do? Or don\'t know and cannot do, but should? Our perception? Emotion? Reason? Language? All of them? Equally in all instances? <br />&bull; Should the Ways of Knowing we use be a function of the nature of what is being assessed? To what extent should we consciously and deliberately use different Ways of Knowing in different circumstances? Should I assess a musical performance or an artwork using the same ways of knowing as I assess the solution of a quadratic equation? How does the medium through which the assessment is undertaken (visual, aural, digital, analogue, for example) affect the findings? <br />&bull; Should my assessments be influenced by the affective context? By the identity, the feelings and emotions of the student(s) at that time? By the anticipated consequences of the outcome of the assessment?<br />&bull; To what extent, if any, do my assessments reflect a cultural bias detrimental to, or improving the outcome? Are those being assessed inherently disadvantaged by the cultural bias of the assessment tasks?<br />&bull; When are we assessing? Always? In real-time (second by second)? Spontaneously, as the perceived need arises? At predetermined intervals? On what bases should the time and frequency of assessments be determined? Do the assessment schedules and examination timetables mandated by the external educational institutions accord with the developmental needs of the students? If not, what are the implications for the way I manage the courses for which I am responsible?</p><p><strong>The benchmarks for IGCSE and IB Diploma Programme assessment</strong><br />In general, there are two different kinds of benchmark against which assessments can be made:<br />&bull; Norm-referencing: the simplest form involves applying a fixed distribution of grades to the results of an assessment<br />&bull; Criterion-referencing: involves making judgements concerning the degree to which a student has met written descriptions that correspond to grades.<br /><strong>Norm-referencing</strong><br />With this method, it is decided in advance that, say, 5% of students in an examination will achieve the top grade, and this figure is maintained from one session to the next. The underlying assumption here is that each cohort of students is interchangeable (in terms of level and spread of performance) with any other cohort. This assumption may not be justified unless the cohort is very large. Also, norm-referencing gives the impression that the score that a student receives is dependent on, and a function of, the performance of other students.<br /><strong>Criterion-referencing</strong><br />With this method, each student&rsquo;s work is evaluated with reference to published Grade Descriptors. These descriptors tend to be rather broad and complex, as they are intended to describe overall standards in a subject course, so often they are broken down into assessment criteria that describe performance in particular skills or topics. This system means that, in principle, the student&rsquo;s performance is measured independently and objectively on its own merit.<br />Both IGCSE and IBDP work is assessed by criterion-referencing. This means that Grade Descriptors are the benchmarks of the assessment process at ARIS.</p><p><strong>Forms of assessment at ARIS</strong><br />What forms of assessment are relevant to our ARIS Secondary School learning environment? What are the various types of assessment task which we may reasonably require of students? What categories or types of assessment are available to us? Informal/formal, casual/rule-governed, transient/permanent, impressionistic/criterion-based, oral/written, formative/summative. And so forth.</p><p>Conventional tasks include:</p><p>&bull; Class Work: short assignments for the individual student without test conditions<br />&bull; Class Quiz: short assignments administered under test conditions in class<br />&bull; Unit Test: more substantial assignment administered under test conditions in class, usually timed to coincide with the end of the treatment of a particular topic<br />&bull; Essay/Written Production: assignment requiring an extended response comprising continuous prose<br />&bull; Presentation: individual or group oral assignment delivered to the teacher or the rest of the class<br />&bull; Commentary: assignment requiring a focused and informed interpretation of a text<br />&bull; Practical Report: recording of an experimental session in the sciences<br />&bull; Production/performance: Musical or dramatic presentation (solo or ensemble)<br />&bull; Exhibition/portfolio: Presentation of art work<br />&bull; Portfolio/Dossier Entry: one of a number of short assignments which collectively form students&rsquo; coursework<br />&bull; Project: individual, perhaps self-directed exercise carried out over an extended period, involving practical activity and report<br />&bull; Oral Task: assignment requiring spoken response<br />&bull; Listening Comprehension: responding to a spoken text<br />&bull; Formal examination.<br />As is to be expected, the menu of appropriate task types varies from one subject to another, and should be elaborated in each set of departmental policies and procedures. In each case, there will be a balance between tasks to be undertaken in the classroom and for homework. There will also be a balance between tasks assigned on individual and group bases.<br />However, our conventional understanding of what properly constitutes classwork and what would normally constitute homework may possibly be inverted by radical changes in pedagogy.</p><p><strong>What assessment guidelines do we use at ARIS?</strong><br />The guidelines for assessment depend on the task. Broadly, there are two types &ndash; both of which are consistent with the process of criterion-referenced assessment:</p><p>&bull; Analytic markschemes: marks are explicitly assigned to specific questions or part of questions; this allows the rewarding of partial success; the markscheme is specific to one examination or test<br />&bull; Assessment Criteria: descriptors of a hierarchy of levels are used on a &lsquo;best fit&rsquo; model; these are appropriate when a task is so open-ended that the variety of valid responses is too great to allow the application of analytic markschemes; the criteria remain the same over different examinations or assignments.</p><p>Students may request to see their own personal assessment record in the form of either reports or transcript. However, they are encouraged to maintain their own record of assessments in their subject portfolios. Teachers may view student records &ndash; either on the network drive or in hard copy from the Head of Secondary&rsquo;s office. Parents have access to assessment records in the form of term reports for their own wards, and will be provided with appropriate whole-school performance information by bulletin and scheduled parent/teacher conferences.</p><p><strong>Who makes the assessments?</strong><br />&bull; Teacher assesses student<br />&bull; Student assesses self<br />&bull; Student assesses other student(s)<br />It is almost self-evident that it is a fundamental aspect of the job of a teacher to make assessments of student work. However, it is also very important that students are given opportunities to assess their own work (self-assessment) and that of other students (peer-assessment). Such processes entail analysis, evaluation and synthesis; in other words, crucial elements in the acquisition of higher order cognitive skills.<br /><strong>What student attributes should be assessed?</strong><br />It is important to be clear about what aspect(s) of the student is/are being assessed. The aspect(s) could be:<br />&bull; Aptitude: an assessment of the student&rsquo;s academic ability or potential<br />&bull; Achievement: an assessment of the student&rsquo;s academic performance (skills and knowledge)<br />&bull; Effort: an assessment of the student&rsquo;s attitude to learning.<br />The distinction between the first two of these attributes is reflected in two types of testing:<br />&bull; Psychometric testing: calibrated short questions to measure aptitude in a particular area, goals are discrimination and ranking<br />&bull; Performance Assessment: students expected to carry out tasks that directly reflect the range of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom (including higher order cognitive skills)</p><p><strong>When and how are these attributes assessed at ARIS?</strong><br />While aptitude, and by inference, potential, might be or should be the focus of assessment in an entrance (placement) examination, assessment of achievement has central importance in everyday school activity. The principal means by which achievement is recorded is through the use of quantitative marks and grades on student work and reports &ndash; representing both ongoing term work and examination performance. The various departmental policies outline the assessment tools employed in each academic subject in order to produce these marks and grades. Constructive comments on student work and in reports are likely to mention effort as well as achievement.<br />&bull; Achievement: assessed formally through marks and grades on individual pieces of submitted work, and through grades and comments attached to term reports <br />&bull; Effort: assessed formally through written comments on individual pieces of submitted work and on term reports as well as through term reports.<br />Both can be assessed less formally through dialogue between student and teacher.</p><p><strong>What are the characteristics of effective assessments?</strong><br />There are two basic aspects of an assessment task that should be constantly kept in mind:<br />&bull; Validity: the extent to which an assessment actually measures what it claims to measure. (In boiling water at sea level at sunset in Tung Lo Wan Road in Hong Kong my thermometer registers 100 degrees Celsius. Is it accurate?)<br />&bull; Reliability: the extent to which similar assessments are consistent over time. (I do the same experiment in the plaza outside the Chilean Naval Academy in Valparaiso at midnight a year later. Is the thermometer reading the same?)<br />IB Diploma Programme example: Pedro from Buenos Aires gets a grade 6 in his Physics HL exam in November 2015. Amanda from Helsinki gets a grade 6 in her Physics HL in May 2016. Alex, the university admissions officer at MIT, needs to be confident that the two candidates have reached similar levels of performance. She wonders about the validity (Do these two Physics exams actually measure what they claim to measure?) and the reliability (Was the Spanish version of the exam in the southern hemisphere summer of 2015 consistent with the English version of the exam in the northern hemisphere summer the following year?).<br />In addition to the basic tenets of validity and reliability there are further considerations to be taken into account in devising effective assessments. For example, bias can be expressed as a difference in outcome of an assessment process that is not related to a genuine difference in the attribute being measured. This is to be avoided wherever possible.<br />Also to be avoided is overlap between the assessment criteria and/or the assignments. Are you measuring the same thing twice, and obtaining different results? To what is the difference attributable? Replication of assessment tasks can also overload students to the extent that the repeated task is approached with a negative attitude, perhaps further skewing the results.<br />In any assessment task there is a balance to be struck between validity and reliability. Validity means that the task measures what it is meant to be measuring; reliability means that the task yields consistent scores at different times and with different teachers.<br />If reliability is over-emphasized at the expense of validity, there is a danger that the task loses its relevance to the desired learning outcomes, and students become burdened with assignments that do not improve their performance. An extreme example of this situation would be setting a multiple choice test to measure students&rsquo; understanding of an historical period or comprehension of a passage from Shakespeare. Students may become de-motivated if they cannot see the point of the assignment or how it could help them.<br />If validity is over-emphasized at the expense of reliability, there is a danger that measurement of student performance will become inconsistent. While the desired learning outcomes might well be addressed, the student&rsquo;s scores might not reflect this effectively, and hence they lose credibility. Students may be justified in feeling that their scores are unfair, and teachers may be hampered in making clear appraisals of students&rsquo; progress. In guarding against this scenario, detailed markschemes can help.<br />Maintaining the balance between validity and reliability becomes particularly challenging when complex, higher-order skills are involved. The founder of the IB, Alec Peterson, put it in this way:<br />\"What is needed is a process of assessment that is as valid as possible, in the sense that it really assesses the whole endowment and personality of the pupil in relation to the next stage of his life, but at the same time is sufficiently reliable to assure pupils, parents and teachers, and receiving institutions, that justice is being done. Yet such a process must not, by its backwash effect, distort good teaching, nor be too slow, nor absorb too much of our scarce educational resources.\" (Alec Peterson, Schools Across Frontiers, Open Court, Illinois 1971)</p><p><strong>Internal examinations</strong><br />It is expected that internal examinations for both IGCSE and IBDP students will, overall, follow the formats of the external IGCSE or IB examinations. A mock exam and the concomitant markscheme should as far as possible be a replica of the &lsquo;real thing&rsquo;, though syllabus content not yet covered in class should obviously be excluded. Apropos of this, the physical environment in which such internal examinations are conducted should also replicate the \'real thing\'. Security of examination question papers and markschemes, seating arrangements in the exam room, invigilator training and so forth should be a dress rehearsal for the performance. Administrators of examinations should never underestimate candidates\' ingenuity in finding shortcuts to success, and the requirements of external examining boards must be adhered to punctiliously.</p><p>A properly balanced examination paper should display an equivalent overall level of difficulty to that of an IGCSE or IB past paper in its entirety. This equivalence legitimizes the use of published grade boundaries from recent IGCSE or IB examinations in the subject (IB data is available on IBIS and from the Subject Reports) as a guide in setting appropriate grade boundaries for the internal examination. Final mark totals or percentages for the internal examination can be converted in this way to generate a 1&minus;7 grade (or its IGCSE equivalent) to describe the student&rsquo;s performance, and thus be a reasonably reliable predictor of future performance, ceteris paribus.</p><p><strong>Coursework</strong><br />The situation described for internal examinations cannot possibly apply to the variety of tasks set by teachers during normal lessons and homework. Thus a different way to arrive at grades must also be devised.</p><p>The rudimentary word descriptions for the 1&minus;7 scale need to be interpreted in the context of Grade Descriptors that, in the case of the IBDP, are published on the OCC for each subject or group of subjects. The equivalent Grade Descriptors for IGCSE subjects are also available in the syllabus documents. Teachers must refer to these descriptors in order to develop and maintain an accurate understanding of what quality of work corresponds to each point on the IGCSE or IB scale for the subject/course concerned. Assigning a grade to a piece of work is a professional judgement made by the teacher in the context of this supporting documentation and his/her previous experience.</p><p>Grade Descriptors should also be engaged in the process of setting an assignment for assessment purposes. In particular, a clear judgement must be made as to whether the assignment, on its own, provides an opportunity for the student to perform at a level corresponding to the top (eg A* or 7) level of the Grade Descriptors. In the case of some simple tasks, this may not be the case, but it is vital that most tasks given during the course of a term challenge students to attain this level of performance. If this approach is not adopted, the assignment set will not adequately be able to differentiate between levels of performance, perhaps causing a modal clustering and/or unrepresentative skewness/kurtosis in the distribution. Such an outcome should not be dismissed as a trivial statistical quirk, as it has a direct impact on the quality of the academic diagnosis and hence on future teaching. It may also be evidence of malpractice.</p><p>If the task allows the student to produce responses across the whole range of descriptors, then the student&rsquo;s response must be evaluated by the award of a grade (eg 1&minus;7). Depending on the subject and the nature of the specific assignment, this grade may be arrived at directly or as the end-product of a marking scheme (this is likely to depend on the degree of structure in the assignment). Where a markscheme is used, the teacher should make a judgement about what scores will correspond to which IGCSE/IBDP grades &ndash; again with reference to the published Grade Descriptors and the teacher&rsquo;s professional experience in the matter.</p><p>If the task does not allow the student to achieve a level of performance consistent with the top end of the Grade Descriptors, this task cannot, on its own, be awarded a score on the A* to G or 1&minus;7 scale. In other words, to set an assignment task where the top grade on the scale used is not achievable would obviously be unfair to the student. In this situation, the mark or score awarded for the assignment should be combined with marks and scores given over the course of the term for other assignments that are of a similar type. For example, class quizzes might be grouped together, or minor homework assignments. By the end of the term, it should be possible to award a grade for the category of work as a whole, as long as the group of tasks taken together have allowed the student access to the entire range of performance grades.</p><p><strong>A coda: Assessment should be neither feared nor revered</strong></p><p>Without pejoratively naming instances, it is claimed that some assessment systems, within which tens of millions of young people are today striving to succeed, are deeply flawed. Some systems have, in some cases irrevocably, fossilised into dead imitations of living organisms. Their operating systems are arcane, obscure, impenetrable, unaccountable and frighteningly complex. Their assessment outcomes, including those star quality grades of which the students dream, are feared and revered. That is not just.</p><p>Such assessment systems are not serving the needs of the generation for whom they have been devised.

However, these three aspects are so inextricably linked they are best not thought of as discrete processes.</p><p>Language plays a vital role in the construction of meaning. It empowers the learner and provides an intellectual framework to support conceptual development and critical thinking. In the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP), it is recognized that the teaching of language should be in response to the previous experience, needs and interests of the student, rather than the consequence of a predetermined, prescriptive model for delivering language. Fragmenting learning into the acquisition of isolated skill sets can create difficulties for learners&mdash;for example, learners may be able to read, write and spell words correctly in isolation but may not be able to read, write or spell those same words in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Learners&rsquo; needs are best served when they have opportunities to engage in learning within meaningful contexts, rather than being presented with the learning of language as an incremental series of skills to be acquired.</strong></p><p>At ARIS, the language profiles of students in are complex and diverse. The influence of mother-tongue development is significant for all learners. <strong>Development of mother-tongue language is crucial for cognitive development, and in maintaining cultural identity.</strong> Success in mother-tongue development is a strong predictor of long-term academic achievement, including acquisition of other languages.</p><h2>English as an Additional Language (EAL) Program</h2><p>Our students come to us with diverse cultural identities and language skills.

Listening, speaking, reading and writing are not separate but inter-related. Our approach to teaching language is holistic. Grammar is taught in context, often related to something the students are writing, and also when speaking, listening and reading.</li><li>All teachers at the school are considered to be language teachers, not only the EAL teachers.</li><li>As students begin their English language learning process, we recognise that each one of them comes to us with a wealth of knowledge and skills.

They are identified as dance, drama, music and visual arts. The four areas are a powerful mode of communication through which students explore and construct a sense of self and develop an understanding of the world. Through Arts, students are exposed to a wide range of opportunities and means to respond to their experiences and engage with historical, social and cultural perspectives. At ARIS, our students are stimulated to articulate their thoughts in diverse ways, as well as through technologies. Arts as an Inquiry provides opportunities for learning, communication and expression, as well as promotes creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving skills and social interactions.</p><h3>Dance</h3><p>Dance in the PYP explores how we express ourselves through movement. To understand and respond to dance, students explore how dance is used in various cultures, rituals and social contexts. Exploring dance in a historical and cultural context and through a variety of genres enriches the student&rsquo;s experience in creating and responding to dance. Also, students are inspired to engage in dance performances to express themselves through their creative movements. From Middle Eastern Folk dances to African dances, students of ARIS are given the opportunities to experience other cultures through movement. Hence, students nurture their physical confidence engaging fully their minds and bodies.</p><h3>Drama</h3><p>Drama in the PYP explores how we express ourselves physically and vocally. Through drama, students are able to explore the use of facial expressions, gestures, movement, posture and vocal techniques to convey emotional or cultural meaning to both characters and stories. At ARIS, students engage in different forms of drama, such as role play, sketches, and scripted drama, presenting their performances to an audience or even to their peers to enable them become a critically aware audience members. Furthermore, through Drama pupils acquire skills to develop their own style in dramatic activities, enhancing their journey in the film-making and theatre industries. The use of ICT in drama setting enhances the creative experience, for instance in creating sound-tracks or video editing.</p><h3>Music</h3><p>Music in the PYP allows students to communicate in a unique way, given the opportunities to explore a wide range of music experiences that include classifying and analyzing sounds, composing, exploring body music, harmonizing, listening, playing instruments, singing, notation, reading music, songwriting and recording. By exposing students to a wide range of musical styles, they are able to understand the context of their environment and that of others, and thus begin to develop personal connections with them.</p><p>At ARIS, students draw on a wide range of music from the Ghanaian and Arab media, and from around the world. Students also explore home-made as well as manufactured instruments from a variety of countries and cultures. ICT is also used to enhance learning music by allowing students to create, compose and record their work through the use of music files and CDs.</p><h3>Visual Arts</h3><p>Visual Arts in the PYP includes &ldquo;art, craft and design&rdquo;. Students are exposed to a broad range of experiences that illustrate the field of visual arts, including bookmaking, architecture, ceramics, collage, costume design, drawing, graphic design, film, illustrations, jewelry, mask making, painting, photography, printmaking sculpture, set design, textiles and woodwork.</p><p>Students are encouraged to experience visual arts of others by inviting artists to the school, or by visiting art galleries and museums, exhibitions, film sets or theatres. By being exposed to diverse artists from all over the world, students begin to appreciate the field of visual arts.</p><p>In addition, ICT is used as a tool to enhance creative experience.

Disciplinary measures may be taken at an early stage to discourage reoffending.</p>\n\n<h3>Stationery and Supplies</h3>\n\n<p>ARIS provides students with tablets, textbooks, and work books where applicable. Before the start of term, parents are provided with a list of additional materials required, according to the student’s Year Group.</p>\n\n<p>Students are responsible for maintaining their textbooks and tablets in good condition and will be charged for any that are lost or damaged.
