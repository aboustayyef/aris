Most importantly, the policy is <em>inclusive</em> rather than <em>exclusive,</em> enabling, insofar as is possible, equity of access to the high quality learning environment that ARIS strives to offer.</p><p>This document depicts the relevant policy and its context, outlines certain of the procedures whereby the policy is effected, and where further explanation may be appropriate, provides some account of the rationale.</p><p>The roots of ARIS are grounded in an indigenous Ghanaian population. However, the student body also reflects much diversity, stemming from relatively mobile families often linked to the world beyond Ghana\'s borders and beyond the region of West Africa via, for example, commercial businesses (at sole trader, corporate and multinational levels), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) charitable foundations and diplomatic missions.</p><p>Collectively, youngsters (now at any age between 4 and 16) whose parents seek their enrolment are exposed to an international <em>Weltanschauung</em> from the outset, if only by reason of peer diversity. International-mindedness is stimulated by everyday social interactions as well as the intrinsic elements of the school\'s globally-referenced curricular content, which is conducive to developing global perspectives.</p><p>A key tenet of the ARIS Mission Statement and Aims is non-discrimination:</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"mission\">Mission</h3><p><em>Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, non-discriminatory community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.</em></p><p><em>The school is dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient and socially responsible students able to take initiative, and endowed with the knowledge, skills and global awareness necessary to continue their education and become active contributors to the global community.</em></p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"aims\">Aims</h3><p><em> By 2018, Al-Rayan International School will be recognized nationally and internationally as a leading international school in Ghana, providing a stimulating multicultural learning environment in accordance with the best international standards in education. . . </em></p><p>The above Mission and Aims are congruent in all respects with the International Baccalaureate Mission Statement.</p><p>Although sponsored by a charitable foundation, The Ghana Society for Islamic Education and Reformation (GSIER), ARIS is a private school largely funded by revenue from tuition fees. Some potential students, therefore, will be unable to enrol because of the (albeit modest) cost of tuition. Establishment of a scholarship fund will be considered as soon as financial circumstances permit.</p><p>A further limitation on a wholly inclusive Admissions Policy is the provision of facilities for the disabled, which are currently inadequate. Again, when financial circumstances permit, improvements will be made in this regard. It is possible that the Student Representative Council will decide to initiate a fund-raising exercise to accelerate such improvements.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission7-9\">Admission to Years 7 &ndash; 9</h3><p>By now the reader will be asking &lsquo;What exactly must my child do to enrol at ARIS?\' The reader should already have clicked the &lsquo;Contact Us\' button on the ARIS website and begun to engage in the form-filling and information-gathering process.</p><p>Because youngsters in different parts of the world begin formal schooling at markedly different chronological ages, a useful preliminary reference might be the chart (on the website) showing the correlation between chronological age and the Year/Class/Grade levels at ARIS. The terminology at ARIS uses &lsquo;Year\', such as a student in Year 6, in Year 9, or whatever.</p><p>The first point of reference for ARIS personnel handling admissions is the applicant student\'s current and/or previous school report(s). A judgement will be made as to the extent to which the report is authentic and a reliable basis for decisions.</p><p>If the child is age-appropriate for Years 7 &ndash; 9, s/he will sit, under examination conditions, a minimum of three entrance tests, in English Language (the medium of instruction in the school), Mathematics and Science respectively. Because the tests are security sensitive, there is no advance notice or other indication of their content.</p><p>The entrance tests are not centred on any one national educational system. To provide valid assessments of the academic attainment and potential of applicants from varied educational origins and educational backgrounds the content of the tests and the assessment instruments used are also varied; diverse in nature to reflect an international perspective and to ensure equity of access.</p><p>The entrance tests and the school report(s) inform the appropriate placement of new students and provide prospective teachers with a profile of the applicant\'s attainment in the relevant subject areas. The tests also function as a diagnostic instrument, highlighting anomalies and providing the basis of an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) compiled by the Special Educational Needs Coordinator. As the title indicates, the IEP is specific to the student. It directly addresses his or her academic needs, identifies &lsquo;SMART\' goals, appropriate teaching strategies to reach them, and a timeline for review.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission10-11\">Admission to Years 10 and 11 (IGCSE)</h3><p>The entrance tests and IEPs as described above are appropriate to applicants for Years 7 &ndash; 9 at any point in the academic year. External applicants, seeking entry to Year 10 at the start of the academic year, will sit tests in the subjects they plan to offer for the International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE), the courses spanning Years 10 and 11.</p><p>If after the commencement of the academic year an applicant is seeking admission to either Year 10 or 11, entrance tests are of necessity closely focused on the syllabus content of the desired courses. Because courses at IGCSE frequently involve optional content, perhaps unique syllabus choices and pedagogical interpretations made by individual teachers, there is much less flexibility in the admissions process, and transition from one school to another is potentially disruptive to the applicant\'s academic progress. The more time which has elapsed since the beginning of the IGCSE course, the more difficult it will be fully to meet the needs of the applicant. A lot of catch-up work may be required, or in extreme cases a subject may need to be abandoned altogether. The ARIS Faculty can be relied upon to do their utmost to resolve such problems in the best interests of the student.</p><p>Appropriate placement in an IGCSE (or IBDP) course can therefore only be achieved when the subject matter already covered by the applicant substantially matches that already covered in the course(s) to which s/he seeks admission. If there is not substantial overlap, bringing the new student into alignment with the progress already made by his or her peers, particularly in content-laden subjects, may be impossible. Subjects where greater emphasis is placed on skills rather than content may be less problematic.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission12\">Admission to Year 12 (IBDP)</h3><p>Admission of ARIS students to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is not automatic. Scheduled in March each year is the first phase of DP orientation for Year 11 students. It is designed to facilitate a clear understanding of the IBDP in general, and its interpretation, principles and practices at ARIS in particular.</p><p>Before addressing the individual circumstances of each student, the first phase of the IBDP orientation is predicated on the assumption that every student will be offering the full Diploma: the core of Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and the Extended Essay (EE), plus three Higher and three Standard Level subjects. Students\' preliminary subject choices will be similarly predicated, and similarly ambitious.</p><p>All students at IBDP level in ARIS will be expected to meet the Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) requirements and fully to participate in TOK classes. It is important that all students have a strong grasp of the underlying philosophy of the DP, and that whatever permutation of subjects they may offer, according to their individual circumstances and needs (perhaps a restricted range leading to certificates), they do not engage in their DP subjects in isolation, but have a sense of the holistic nature of the programme, its intention to educate the whole person, and its potential impact on their future lives.</p><p>The IBDP is academically rigorous. To be assured of a subject profile that enables eligibility for the award of the full Diploma, students should be seeking to attain at least six IGCSE subject passes at grade C or better, including English Language, a Science and Mathematics. For the three subjects to be taken at Higher Level, students should be seeking grades of B, A or A*.</p><p>A great many considerations, of course, must be taken into account in the construction of a DP subject profile appropriate to the individual student. The profile will accommodate as far as possible a recognition of the intelligences of the student, and his or her abilities, potentials and aspirations. And the process of constructing a profile extends beyond the empirically verifiable evidence of academic ability to less readily quantified attributes of the person, such as commitment, attitude, altruism and sense of responsibility to others. Attributes, perhaps, that mirror the IB Learner Profile, and which engagement with the DP will continue to cultivate.</p><p>ARIS is proud of the many ways support is provided to new students, particularly those facing language difficulties, and/or whose academic background (for whatever reason) signifies deficiencies in syllabus coverage or competencies in essential areas of the curriculum, such as mathematics and the sciences. The IEPs are devised and implemented to ensure that students experiencing these difficulties are soon able to match the progress of their peers.</p><p><em> &lsquo;Will this prospective student benefit from the educational programme available at ARIS?\' </em> That is the question which informs all decisions on admission.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>','','normal','admissions-policy',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2015-02-13 20:18:28',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(37,'Admissions Procedure',5,NULL,'<p>Admission is conditional upon parental agreement that students will participate fully in the curriculum and all related activities.&nbsp; The school curriculum does not include elements that would be disrespectful to any race or religion.</p><p>The School has a limited capacity and at times may have to operate with a waiting list; in that event priority is given to siblings of current students in good standing.&nbsp; Children will be asked to take a test to demonstrate an appropriate level of English competence relevant to their age group.&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s place on the waiting list is determined by the date the application is completed and all documentation and payments are received.</p><p>Once the admission documentation has been received and if it is realistic that a place will become available, the school will arrange an admission assessment.

On the first floor are found the Science Labs and store, the Digital Learning Centre, an ICT Lab and administrative offices. On the top floor are five more classrooms, an IT-equipped student workroom and the Art Room. Faculty and students strive to take maximum advantage of technology in the learning environment; at any one time there may be up to 100 desktop computers, portables and tablets linked to the Intranet and Internet.</p><p>When complete, the new complex will house 1,200 students and will include a range of first-rate learning facilities designed to optimise the students\' educational experience. The new campus will reflect local Ghanaian culture and utilise green technological features in buildings, and a landscape exemplifying sustainable environmental practices.</p><div class=\"videoWrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rPSWW53-Js\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div><p>There will be four main blocks, a separate Early Childhood Development Centre, a Counselling Centre, English as an Additional Language (AEL) and Special Educational Needs (SEN) Centres, a &lsquo;Roman Amphitheatre&rsquo; (for al fresco arts events), a large Multipurpose Hall seating 500, four Science Labs, four ICT Labs, two Media and Language Labs, three Libraries, a Music Room, and two Visual Arts studios.</p><p>Additional facilities will include: three canteens, a school store, a swimming pool, basketball and volleyball courts, a full gymnasium, a football pitch and a school clinic.

Daily class attendance is a condition for fulfilling specific requirements, course completion obligations, and general academic progress at the school. Educational achievement is earned by the student&rsquo;s participation in class through discussion, written work, and examinations; the student must be in class to progress.</p><p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency. Parents may excuse their children from school for the above reasons, but ARIS may at its own discretion not honour parent-signed excuses for any other reasons. Because of the almost inevitable toll on academic progress, in particular, the school seeks willing co-operation from parents in exercising the utmost restraint in excusing their children from school.</p><p>The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing attendance procedures, and for ensuring that:</p><p>1- Attendance is checked and reported daily<br />2- A daily record of attendance is maintained and logged, and<br />3- Written explanations are submitted by parents for all absences.</p><p>Because institutions responsible for the next phase of any student&rsquo;s education will require it, the record of attendance becomes a permanent element in a student&rsquo;s file.</p><p>If poor attendance persists, it may be necessary to have the student repeat all or part of the school year, or to request that the parents withdraw the student from the school.</p><p>A student absent for nine days or more (excused or unexcused) during the term will receive formal acknowledgement of school attendance only upon review of the circumstances of the absences and final level of achievement in coursework. At the discretion of the Head of Secondary, additional assessment may be required to fulfil the course requirements.</p><p>Compensation (make-up) for extended absences for medical reasons should be arranged through the subject teacher(s) in consultation with the Head of Secondary. Students are responsible for making up all missed work, whether or not an absence was excused. Credit will not be given for work made up after an unexcused absence.</p><h4>Excusable and Inexcusable Absences</h4><h5>Excusable</h5><p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved in advance by the Head of Secondary. The Faculty will make reasonable efforts to assist students in making up school work for excused absences, but will also be considering that in doing so their attention may be diverted from the needs of the majority of students in the class. Students absent on the day of a test are expected to make up the test immediately upon return to school and may be required to do this during break time.</p><p>In the event of illness or other unforeseen absence, parents are requested to call Reception and report the student&rsquo;s absence by 08.00 latest. They should then follow-up with a note on the student&rsquo;s return to class. When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a planned absence form and return it to their Homeroom Teacher.</p><h5>Inexcusable</h5><p>Inexcusable absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Head of Secondary. Work missed for such absences must be completed but will be not be given credit and will be graded as zero. Inexcusable absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p><p>Following any non-school related absence from class, students must immediately on their return provide their Homeroom Teacher with a clear written explanation from parents explaining the reason for the absence. The absence will be classified as inexcusable until an adequate explanation is received. Parents should notify Reception each day of the absence, unless the school has been notified of a protracted absence in advance.</p><h4>Truancy</h4><p>The school will attempt to contact the parents if the student is inexplicably absent. Truancy is considered to be a student missing part or all of the school day without the parents\' and the school\'s permission. Going off campus without permission during the school day constitutes truancy.</p><p>Obviously, truancy has a deleterious effect on the student\'s educational progress. The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing procedures to deal with truancy and the consequences thereof. Disciplinary action may entail up to three days suspension, which again will be permanently on record.</p>',NULL,'normal','attendance-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:30:11','2015-02-12 20:17:54',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(66,'Network Policy',15,NULL,'<p>Network Policy</p>',NULL,'normal','network-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:31:16','2014-10-26 09:31:16',0,NULL),(67,'Academic Honesty Policy',15,NULL,'<p id=\"start\"><strong>Document Outline</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a></li><li><a href=\"#academicdishonestyandmalpractice\">Academic dishonesty and malpractice</a></li><li><a href=\"#consequences\">The consequences of malpractice</a></li><li><a href=\"#typesof\">types of malpractice &amp; context / suggested consequences</a></li><li><a href=\"#detection\">the detection of plagiarism</a></li><li><a href=\"#authenticating\">authenticating candidates&rsquo; work</a></li><li><a href=\"#bibliographies\">bibliographies, references and citations</a></li><li><a href=\"#whatisb\">what is a bibliography?</a></li><li><a href=\"#whatisr\">what is a reference?</a></li><li><a href=\"#whatisc\">what is a citation?</a></li><li><a href=\"#notes\">author&rsquo;s note</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Academic honesty is a core element in the IBO document: Programme Standards and Practices (2014), a document which is key to how IB Programmes must operate in IB World Schools.</p><p>An explicit, fundamental aim of the ARIS mission is to draw on the cultural diversity of the school community as a foundation for building universal human values in a complex and rapidly changing global environment, and for preparing its students to be responsible citizens who exhibit honesty and integrity in what they do. It should be our responsibility to inculcate these values of honesty and integrity in our students from an early age and to do our best to ensure that these values last.</p><p>This policy document, focused on Academic Honesty, is intended to be concise, and stems from, and is coherent with, the school&rsquo;s commitment to academic honesty and integrity. Academic honesty is a fundamental tenet of the ARIS philosophy and accordingly is integral to the life-long values which ARIS aims to inculcate in its students, from Primary Years to the Diploma Programme.</p><p>A prior assumption is that ARIS students and teachers are honest by nature, proud of that, and wish to remain so. An important educational aim for ARIS teachers, however, is to reinforce that innate honesty and thus enable students to derive satisfaction from their own accomplishments, secure in the knowledge that their accomplishments are indeed their own.</p><p>Academic honesty should be seen as a set of values, reinforced by skills that promote personal integrity and good practice in teaching, learning and assessment. Academic honesty is influenced and shaped by a variety of factors including peer pressure, culture, parental expectations, role- modelling and taught skills. Academic dishonesty may stem from similar origins: your classmates are getting away with it, why shouldn\'t you? Your own culture respects emulation of those recognised as the finest practitioners. Therefore copy the best. If you fail, you fail your family. And so on.</p><p>It is argued here that although it is easier to explain to students what constitutes academic dishonesty, with direct reference to examples of plagiarism, collusion and cheating in exams, whenever possible the topic should be treated by teachers in a positive way, stressing the educational benefits which accrue when, for example, academic research is properly conducted, when the temptation to take shortcuts is resisted, and when the borrowing or outright theft of someone else\'s ideas and presenting them as one\'s own is seen as reprehensible.</p><p>This policy document includes:</p><ul><li>possible definitions of what constitutes academic dishonesty, malpractice, plagiarism and intellectual property</li><li>an account of the consequences of academic dishonesty at ARIS and the suggested consequences that will occur if a student is found guilty</li><li>examples of conventions for citing and acknowledging original authorship</li><li>guidance on the distinction between legitimate collaboration and unacceptable collusion (different from collaboration) or plagiarism.</li></ul><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"academicdishonestyandmalpractice\">ACADEMIC DISHONESTY AND MALPRACTICE</h2><h3>Definition of terms</h3><p>The IBO regulations, for example, define malpractice as behaviour that results in, or may result in, the student gaining an unfair advantage (relative to other students) in one or more assessment components. Malpractice includes:</p><ul><li><strong>plagiarism:</strong> this is defined as the representation of the ideas or work of another person as the student\'s own</li><li><strong>collusion:</strong> this is defined as supporting malpractice by another student, as in allowing one&rsquo;s work to be copied or submitted for assessment by another</li><li><strong>duplication</strong> of work: this is defined as the presentation of the same work for different subjects, assessment components and/or requirements</li><li>the taking of unauthorised material into an examination room, or disrupting an examination</li><li><strong>any other behaviour that gains an unfair advantage</strong> for a student or that affects the results of another student.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that malpractice, unfortunately, is not confined to offences by students.</p><p>The intellectual property of others may also be misused. Intellectual property is property that is the result of creativity. It does not exist in tangible, legal form, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks et cetera, but is nevertheless the product of another person\'s work. Examples include a variety of sources (CD-ROMs, DVDs, photographs, illustrations, art works, music and data) in addition to journals, books and web sites.</p><p>Students and teachers must be aware that the requirement to acknowledge sources extends beyond text taken from the Internet, CD-ROMs, books, magazines and journals. The concepts of intellectual property and academic honesty include, for example, the use of footnotes or endnotes to acknowledge the source of an idea if that idea emerged as a result of discussion with, or listening to, a fellow student, a teacher or any other person.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"consequences\">THE CONSEQUENCES OF MALPRACTICE</h2><p>While ARIS does its utmost to develop in students the highest ethical standards in academic work, there may arise occasions when those standards are breached. The table overleaf is intended to provide examples of breaches of academic honesty, in various contexts, and their recommended consequences. It is not exhaustive. A basic premise is that academic dishonesty is a gross breach of the educational values which ARIS attempts to inculcate; therefore all proven cases of academic dishonesty should be:</p><ul><li>followed by the stated disciplinary action (consequence)</li><li>permanently documented in the student\'s file</li><li>reported in writing to the parents/guardians.</li></ul><p>In spite of what was stated on the first page of this paper, ie that malpractice entails a deliberate attempt to gain academic advantage, it will almost invariably be difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the attempt to gain academic advantage was intentional. Hence, should evidence of intention to deceive be uncovered, or should the intention be admitted by the suspect, it should not be held as key to the proof of malpractice, rather, it should be considered as corroboratory. The \' key to the proof of malpractice\' is the documentary or other evidence.</p><p>Investigations of suspicions of academic dishonesty should be conducted in a heuristic, rather than an inquisitorial, confrontational or adversarial style. The aim of an investigation should be to discover the truth of the matter, rather than to intimidate or threaten the student suspected. The student should be entitled to have a witness or a trusted teacher present if s/he so chooses. Not, however, a parent, guardian or lawyer whose independence of judgement may be compromised.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"typesof\">TYPES OF MALPRACTICE &amp; CONTEXT / SUGGESTED CONSEQUENCES</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Offence<sup>1</sup></th><th>Context<sup>2</sup></th><th>Suggested Consequence</th></tr><tr><td>plagiarism</td><td>Homework/class tests</td><td>Disciplinary action as appropriate, mark of zero awarded and loss of grade.

The context in which malpractice has been proven is not necessarily relevant to the gravity of the offence. Other factors, such the extent to which a piece of work has been plagiarised, the extent to which other students may be complicit in the offence, and the number (if any) of previous proven cases on the part of the offending student should be the main determinants of disciplinary measures.</li><li>The IBO has detailed and stringently applied procedures for dealing with academic malpractice that extend beyond the scope of this document. All cases are considered by the IBO Final Award Committee. Preventative vigilance is the collective responsibility of IBDP teachers. Notification to the IBO of proven instances of malpractice is the responsibility of the IBDP Coordinator.</li></ol><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"detection\">The detection of plagiarism</h3><p>It is the ARIS student who should be ultimately responsible for ensuring that all work submitted for assessment is authentic, not the teacher or the EE supervisor (though of course they have a major responsibility). The work or ideas of others must be fully and correctly cited and acknowledged. Students should be expected to review their own work before submission for assessment to identify any passages, data, graphs, photographs, computer programmes and so on that still require acknowledgment.</p><p>The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, published in August 2014 and available on the OCC, provides useful guidance as to why, when, what and how to cite source materials. Teachers should familiarise students with the content of this document when appropriate.</p><p>When reading students\' work teachers should be vigilant for obvious changes in the style of writing. Equally significant is a style that seems too mature, too error free and perhaps more characteristic of an experienced academic than a secondary school student. Evidence of copying and pasting may immediately be obvious from inconsistent fonts and/or kerning.</p><p>Over the period of the courses in the Primary and Secondary Schools teachers will, or at least should, become very familiar with the style and quality of each student\'s work in their classes. It is therefore the teachers who are in the best position to identify work that may not be authentic, and if the student knows the teacher is vigilant, s/he may be less tempted to resort to plagiarism in times of stress or crisis. If such stresses or crises occur, the student should be encouraged to seek the solace of the Guidance Counsellor. Malpractice, whether detected or not, will only exacerbate emotional stress.</p><p>Although in most cases of plagiarism that come to the attention of the Examining Boards the candidate has copied passages from a web site, there is still frequent plagiarism from books and journals, in addition to the illicit use of photographs, graphs, data and computer programmes from a variety of sources. In many cases it is likely that the teacher is familiar with the books being used by candidates; they may be standard textbooks for the subject, or books that are readily available in the school library. The author of this paper knows of one instance where the teacher himself was the author of the work plagiarised.</p><p>The teacher must be alert for familiar passages or fragments of passages loosely assembled, perhaps without grammatical or ideational coherence. If necessary, the teacher should check that such passages have not been copied from elsewhere. In the first instance, a mere chat with the student about the content of the suspect work may reveal that the student has only a superficial understanding of what s/he has written.</p><p>To be introduced to the Theory of Knowledge assessment for the May 2015 examination session, but not yet available at the time of writing (October 2014) is a requirement that in the course of the students&rsquo; preparation of the essay on a Prescribed Title teachers conduct several &lsquo;interactions&rsquo; with the student author. This is to ensure that the essay has guided by an appropriate level of professional input from the designated teacher and/or class discussions, and not by an internet mentor (a euphemism for someone paid to write the essay on behalf of the student). It could be argued that, had TOK teachers collectively been more vigilant in the prevention of plagiarism, such draconian counter-measures at the strategic level would never have been necessary.</p><p>In the IBDP, at least, assessment is an integral element of the curriculum. Academic malpractice at times appears to be driving assessment development regressively, in directions less and less conducive to the optimal teaching and learning context.</p><p>With the growth of the Internet and corresponding increase in its use, the abuse of electronic media is now, sadly, prevalent within the academic community. Aside from the immense number of legitimate websites, there are an increasing number of sites that actively encourage students to plagiarise and purchase essays, such as the TOK one mentioned. Little can be done to prevent the emergence of these sites, but the Internet can also be used for detecting academic dishonesty. Several of the more efficient search engines can be used to detect the source of passages that have been plagiarised, although with the exponential growth in the quantity of stored data this is becoming less and less feasible.</p><p>There are several websites that offer a useful service in detecting plagiarism from the Internet, for example, http://turnitin.com to which ARIS may decide to maintain a subscription. Again, however, it must be stressed that software of this kind can easily be circumvented; there is no substitute for the teachers&rsquo; vigilance. The discussions among teachers new to this type of software often indicate that the teachers have not themselves internalised the ability to differentiate qualitatively between examples of plagiarised and examples of authentic student work. They are reliant instead on seemingly authoritative, computer-generated indicators of &lsquo;percentage copied&rsquo;, prettily colour coded; indicators which may be themselves be based on spurious data. It is important that ARIS teachers develop, over time, the ability to identify atypical work.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"authenticating\">Authenticating candidates&rsquo; work</h3><p>It is the responsibility of teachers to support students in the preparation of their work for assessment and to ensure that all student work complies with the requirements of the relevant curriculum guidelines. Therefore, teachers (or supervisors in the case of IB Extended Essays) are in by far the best position to judge whether a candidate&rsquo;s work is authentic. Ongoing support and guidance will help with the early detection of unintentional plagiarism and will dissuade students from deliberate plagiarism because they know their work is regularly subject to scrutiny. However, what is realistic and what can be achieved within the usual constraints of time and workload must be left to the discretion of teachers and the relevant coordinator.</p><p>As previously stated, the candidates are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the final version of any work is authentic. Candidates themselves must bear the consequences if they submit any work for assessment that is not their own, regardless of whether the plagiarism was unintentional or deliberate. The same principle applies to collusion.</p><p>If the coordinator and/or a teacher has reason to believe that part or the whole of a candidate&rsquo;s draft work submitted for discussion prior to final submission might be deemed to be in violation of the principles of academic honesty and constitutes a case of malpractice, they must draw the candidate&rsquo;s attention to this risk and to her/his duty to respect the policy and requirements of academic honesty.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"bibliographies\">Bibliographies, references and citations</h3><p>All work submitted for assessment must reflect intellectual honesty in research practices and provide the reader with the exact sources of quotations, ideas and points of view through accurate bibliographies and referencing. The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, (mentioned on page 4) is a useful resource for both students and teacher.</p><p>Producing accurate citations, referencing and a bibliography is a skill that students should be seeking to perfect. Documenting the research in this way is vital: it allows readers to evaluate the evidence for themselves and it shows the student&rsquo;s understanding of the importance of the sources used.</p><p><em>Failure to comply with this requirement will be viewed as plagiarism and will, therefore, be treated as a case of malpractice</em>.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisb\">What is a bibliography?</h3><p>A bibliography is an alphabetical list of every source used. Sources that are not cited in the body of the piece of work, but were important in informing the approach taken, should be cited in the introduction or in an acknowledgment. The bibliography should list only those sources cited. Examiners will not be impressed by a long and stylish list that bears little or no connection with the text of the piece of work. Rather, such a list may remind the examiner of the extent of the resources spurned by the student.</p><p>There are a number of different documentation styles available for use when writing research papers at IBDP level; most are appropriate in some academic disciplines but not others. The IB does not mandate use of a particular style, rather that just one be used and presented consistently, and above all, when used as a reference (see below), enables the reader (examiner) to trace the source. If the bibliographical item cannot be accessed on the basis of the information provided, or, if it was transient, contain evidence that it once existed, the information might as well not be there.</p><p>The teacher should help students decide on a citation style for the particular piece of work set. It is important to remember that, whatever style is chosen, it must be simple to use and must be applied consistently. When choosing the style, the student needs to have a clear understanding of how it is to be used before embarking on the work. The style should be applied at all stages in the production of the piece of work. This is good practice, not only for producing a high-quality final product, but also for reducing the opportunities and temptation to plagiarise.</p><p>Finding information about citation/documentation styles is not difficult. Entering a string, such as \'academic referencing\', into an Internet search engine will bring up lots of useful material. Or the student can simply copy the style (not the content) shown in the main textbook used in researching the topic s/he is writing about. That will not be construed as plagiarism!</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisr\">What is a reference?</h3><p>A reference is a way of indicating to the reader, in an orderly and systematic form, where information has been obtained. A reference provides all the information needed to find/trace the source material. References must be included because they acknowledge the sources used, and enable the reader to trace and consult the source work and verify the data that has been presented. If the reference does not enable the reader to trace and consult the source work, then it is useless.</p><p>References must be given whenever someone else&rsquo;s work is quoted or summarized. References can come from many different sources, including books, magazines, journals, newspapers, e-mails, Internet sites and interviews. Internet references should include the title of the extract used as well as the web site address, the date it was accessed and, if possible, its author.</p><p>Caution should be exercised with information on web sites that do not give references or that cannot be cross-checked against other sources. The more important a particular point is to the essay, the more the quality of its source needs to be evaluated. And if a particular source is alluded to time and time again, is reliability and authenticity is all the more important. As a TOK student will know, frequency of reference, which is one of the factors which propel a website to prominence in a web search, is just one test of truth.</p><p>Any references to interviews (transient) should state the name of the interviewer, the name of the interviewee, the date and the place of the interview.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisc\">What is a citation?</h3><p>A citation is a shorthand method of making a reference in the body of an essay, which is then linked to the full reference at the end of the essay. A citation provides the reader with accurate references so that s/he can locate the source easily. How sources are cited varies with the particular documentation style that has been chosen.

However, these three aspects are so inextricably linked they are best not thought of as discrete processes.</p><p>Language plays a vital role in the construction of meaning. It empowers the learner and provides an intellectual framework to support conceptual development and critical thinking. In the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP), it is recognized that the teaching of language should be in response to the previous experience, needs and interests of the student, rather than the consequence of a predetermined, prescriptive model for delivering language. Fragmenting learning into the acquisition of isolated skill sets can create difficulties for learners&mdash;for example, learners may be able to read, write and spell words correctly in isolation but may not be able to read, write or spell those same words in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Learners&rsquo; needs are best served when they have opportunities to engage in learning within meaningful contexts, rather than being presented with the learning of language as an incremental series of skills to be acquired.</strong></p><p>At ARIS, the language profiles of students in are complex and diverse. The influence of mother-tongue development is significant for all learners. <strong>Development of mother-tongue language is crucial for cognitive development, and in maintaining cultural identity.</strong> Success in mother-tongue development is a strong predictor of long-term academic achievement, including acquisition of other languages.</p><h2>English as an Additional Language (EAL) Program</h2><p>Our students come to us with diverse cultural identities and language skills.

An equally important concern is to enable students to access all curriculum areas. Therefore, EAL students attend most classes with their peers.</li><li>In order to enable students to develop confidence, skills and knowledge, EAL teachers work alongside class teachers to plan, teach and assess students&rsquo; understanding of our curriculum.

In addition, EAL teachers attend parent-teacher conferences and include learning with the EAL teacher in the students&rsquo; portfolios.</li></ul><h3>Practice</h3><ul><li>Al-Rayan believes that students learn language, about language and through language. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are not separate but inter-related. Our approach to teaching language is holistic. Grammar is taught in context, often related to something the students are writing, and also when speaking, listening and reading.</li><li>All teachers at the school are considered to be language teachers, not only the EAL teachers.</li><li>As students begin their English language learning process, we recognise that each one of them comes to us with a wealth of knowledge and skills. We encourage students to use their mother tongue to develop English skills. For this reason, we allow students to use their own language when appropriate. For higher Primary students, we expect them to use bilingual dictionaries and other reference materials in their mother tongue to assist their learning.</li><li>Teachers who speak the mother tongue assist in translation for a period of time till the student can understand the basic spoken English.</li><li>In the early stages of learning a language, learners may go through what is called &lsquo;the silent stage.&rsquo; We respect this. As students begin to speak in English, we celebrate their courage. In the process of learning English, students will make mistakes. We recognize that making mistakes is an essential part of learning needed to develop language skills.</li><li>At ARIS, we use literature from around the world to embrace the student body&rsquo;s multiculturalism.

Assessment, therefore, is considered to be an intrinsic element of the curriculum, having a number of purposes that are essential to the educational process. These include assessment for learning (providing feedback in support of the learning process), and summative assessment (determining a student&rsquo;s level of performance).</p><p>The quality of teaching (pedagogy) is a critical determining factor in students&rsquo; development.

The Student Representative Council (SRC) is a more formal means whereby the interests of students can be coordinated to fulfil this expectation.</p>',NULL,'normal','code-of-conduct',NULL,'2014-12-16 09:08:53','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,NULL),(108,'Attendance Policy',104,NULL,'<h3>Student Absences</h3>\n\n<p>The ARIS educational programme is based on the assumption that students will attend school regularly. Daily class attendance is a condition for fulfilling specific requirements, course completion obligations, and general academic progress at the school. Educational achievement is earned by the student’s participation in class through discussion, written work, and examinations; the student must be in class to progress.</p>\n\n<p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency. Parents may excuse their children from school for the above reasons, but ARIS may at its own discretion not honour parent-signed excuses for any other reasons. Because of the almost inevitable toll on academic progress, in particular, the school seeks willing co-operation from parents in exercising the utmost restraint in excusing their children from school. </p>\n\n<p>The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing attendance procedures, and for ensuring that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attendance is checked and reported daily</li> \n<li>A daily record of attendance is maintained and logged, and</li> \n<li>Written explanations are submitted by parents for all absences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because institutions responsible for the next phase of any student’s education will require it, the record of attendance becomes a permanent element in a student’s file.</p>\n\n<p>If poor attendance persists, it may be necessary to have the student repeat all or part of the school year, or to request that the parents withdraw the student from the school.</p>\n\n<p>A student absent for nine days or more (excused or unexcused) during the term will receive formal acknowledgement of school attendance only upon review of the circumstances of the absences and final level of achievement in coursework.  At the discretion of the Head of Secondary, additional assessment may be required to fulfil the course requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Compensation (make-up) for extended absences for medical reasons should be arranged through the subject teacher(s) in consultation with the Head of Secondary. Students are responsible for making up all missed work, whether or not an absence was excused. Credit will not be given for work made up after an unexcused absence.</p>\n\n<h3>Excusable and Inexcusable Absences</h3>\n\n<h4>Excusable</h4>\n\n<p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved by the Head of Secondary.  The Faculty will make reasonable efforts to assist students in making up school work for excused absences, but will also be considering that in doing so their attention may be diverted from the needs of the majority of students in the class.  Students absent on the day of a test are expected to make up the test immediately upon return to school and may be required to do this during break time.</p>\n\n<p>In the event of illness or other unforeseen absence, parents are requested to call Reception and report the student’s absence by 08.00 latest. They should then follow-up with a note on the student’s return to class.  When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a planned absence form and return it to their Homeroom Teacher.</p>\n\n<h4>Inexcusable</h4>\n\n<p>Inexcusable absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Head of Secondary.  Work missed for such absences must be completed but will be not be given credit and will be graded as zero.  Inexcusable absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p>\n\n<p>Following any non-school related absence from class, students must immediately on their return provide their Homeroom Teacher with a clear written explanation from parents explaining the reason for the absence.  The absence will be classified as inexcusable until an adequate explanation is received.  Parents should notify Reception each day of the absence, unless the school has been notified of a protracted absence in advance.</p>\n\n<h3>Truancy</h3>\n\n<p>The school will attempt to contact the parents if the student is inexplicably absent. Truancy is considered to be a student missing part or all of the school day without the parents\' and the school\'s permission.  Going off campus without permission during the school day constitutes truancy.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, truancy has a deleterious effect on the student\'s educational progress. The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing procedures to deal with truancy and the consequences thereof.  Disciplinary action may entail up to three days suspension, which again will be permanently on record. </p> \n',NULL,'normal','attendance-policy',NULL,'2014-12-16 09:19:17','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,NULL),(109,'Security Policy',104,NULL,'<p>Some say we live in a dangerous world.
