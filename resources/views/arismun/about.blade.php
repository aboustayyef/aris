<p>For our very first conference, the ARISMUN secretariat has carefully curated topics for each committee with topics that are relevant to current situations and aim to stimulate intense debates and discussions that eventually lead to the drafting of feasible solutions. Committees for our conference will include the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Security Council (UNSC), UN Women, Disarmament and International Security (DISEC), General Assembly (GA), a very special Crisis Committee, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ).</p>
