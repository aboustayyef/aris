                My name is Nadia Abdoulaye and I am currently an IB DP final year student at Al- Rayan International
                School. I joined MUN thinking it was just another club. “It will look great on my college application”,
                I thought as I handed in my form. This mentality changed after the first committee session of my first
                conference. I was so captivated by the diplomacy and seriousness of it all and I was determined to excel
                in it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Although I was quite new to the parliamentary procedure(and honestly very confused about it all), I did
                not let that stop me from winning the position of ‘Best New Delegate’ in my committee last year. MUN has
                become such an important part of my life. I enjoy MUN because unlike any other club I am involved in, it
                allows me to grow and broaden my knowledge on how the world functions.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have acquired and developed so many skills and I have made my “forever” friends in this club. When I
                am not busy with school work or drafting resolutions or opening speeches, I enjoy reading, listening to
                music, watching movies, and interacting with my friends.
              </p>

              <p>
                I hope your MUN experience has been an exciting one, and I look forward to fruitful and meaningful
                interactions with you all!

                Hello! I am Fidaus Alfa, a final year student in Al-Rayan International school and will be your USG of
                delegate affairs at ARISMUN. My MUN journey started 6 years ago when I was forced into the club because
                I was too quiet and reserved. At that point what could I possibly do? It took time for me to be able to
                open up and debate. I used to sit through committee sessions for hours without uttering a single word. I
                kept thinking “okay I will raise my placard next” and then chicken out.
              </p>

              <p>
                I had my MUN breakthrough when our MUN club held a simulation during assembly to show the other students
                what it was like. I was Burundi in the Burundi crisis. My director did this to push me and break my
                shell open. I guess it worked after all. All it took was me asking my first point of information. All of
                a sudden MUN was no longer a measure my parents put in place to open me up. It became a part of me, I
                was able to communicate better in general.
              </p>

              <p>
                Debating became one of my favourite things to do. This experience is one that I hold close to my heart
                and I hope this virtual conference will be a lifetime experience for many of the delegates attending.

                Hi! I'm Sara Minai and I'm the DSG of this year's conference:) It's an absolute honour and pleasure to
                be a member of the secretariat and I couldn't ask for a better team to work with. This is my fifth year
                in MUN and thirteenth year in ARIS, practically my second home now! MUN has always been a platform for
                me to be able to meet new people and develop problem solving and public speaking skills, I hope it
                becomes the same for you.
              </p>

              <p>
                Despite having participated in a vast number of conferences since 2015, ARISMUN 2020 will be the first
                time I serve as a member of the Secretariat. I aim to approach this conference with the experience of a
                veteran and the enthusiasm of a newcomer and I’m looking forward to welcoming you all, even if it's
                through a screen.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was also asked to describe myself, but there's no way I could do that and still seem interesting
                enough. Ummm, I'm an avid listener of Harry Styles, Maggie Rogers and Nick Drake. I'm notorious amongst
                my (three) friends for knock-knock jokes and that's it really. I really hope that this conference lives
                up to your expectations and that you have the most incredible time ever. That's what MUN is really about.

                Although this is my first time as USG of IT, my team and I are working hard to ensure that you have the

              <p>My name is Anik Mukherjee and I’m from India. I’ve lived in Rwanda for 13 years of my life, but for the past 4 years, Ghana has been my home. I am in my final year of High School at Al-Rayan International School where I’m completing the second year of IB. I’ve always had a passion for debate. I was in my high school debate team from the age of 12 where I made my way to finals, debating with high school seniors and other students way older than I was.</p>

              <p>My passion for debate led me to join MUN once I got the chance. Since then, I’ve attended a handful of conferences gaining valuable experience and recognition. As USG of Chairs and a member of the Secretariat for this conference, I’ll work closely with the secretariat and committee staff to ensure that ARISMUN is of high quality and standard.</p>
