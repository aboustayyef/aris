We are dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient, independent and socially responsible students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be active contributors in the global community. In this way, we are more than just a school, we are a place from which students emerge as inspired, able and responsible stewards of our global society and the natural environment.</p><p><br />The ARIS family is undertaking big challenges in the coming five years, as our guiding statements illustrate.

Our Primary School offers an engaging, quality curriculum from the Playgroup (ages 2-3) and the Primary Years Programme (PYP) Nursery through to Year 6 (ages 3-12). The Primary School, now a PYP Candidate School, is seeking authorization from the International Baccalaureate Organization for the PYP, whose philosophy provides a framework that enables us to educate our pupils to face the challenges of the 21st century by guiding and supporting them to becoming independent, life-long learners who are responsible, productive, insightful and compassionate; motivated to become peaceful and internationally-minded citizens of the world.</p><p>Our programme focuses on developing independent, skilled learners through an Inquiry&ndash;based teaching and learning approach that reflects a uniquely global perspective. Even though our curriculum is based on the PYP, compatibility has been ensured with the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) framework and the British National Curriculum.</p><p>At ARIS, each and every child is unique. Our teachers and staff are dedicated to bringing out the best in our students. As Paulo Coelho once stated, &ldquo;A teacher isn&rsquo;t someone who teaches something, but someone who inspires the student to give of his/ her best in order to discover what he/she already knows.&rdquo;</p><p><br />I am privileged and excited to be a part of this dynamic school community, and hope to demonstrate in practice our commitment and enthusiasm for everything we do.</p><p>Yours Sincerely,&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/people/dania-sadek\">Dania Sadek</a></p>',NULL,'normal','from-the-head-of-primary',NULL,'2015-02-25 17:47:16','2015-03-19 13:06:25',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(11,'Guiding Statement',1,'Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, non-discriminatory community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.','<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/mission.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><h2>Mission</h2><p>Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.</p><p>The school is dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient and socially responsible students able to take initiatives, and endowed with the knowledge, skills and global awareness necessary to continue their education and become active contributors to the global community.</p><p>It is our task to keep the welfare and wellbeing of our students at the forefront and provide them with a morally sound environment.</p><h2>Aims</h2><p>By 2018, Al-Rayan International School will be recognized nationally and internationally as a leading international school in Ghana, providing a stimulating multicultural learning environment in accordance with the best international standards in education.

We encourage children to &ldquo;know&rdquo; each other by means of tolerance, respect, understanding and gender equality, all through the exchange of knowledge in a global community.</p><p>In order to nurture a moral compass in the children, ARIS implements a holistic approach to Spiritual, Moral, Social and Cultural-SMSC development. We deeply value the SMSC aspects of life that help us to understand what it is to be human. This richness of SMSC is threaded through our school environment. Adults lead the way in empowering children to learn about the world beyond the classroom and fathom their place in it, a world with a plethora of backgrounds, views and faiths; to be accepted, cherished and understood.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.&rdquo; (Quran 30:22)</blockquote><p>It is this school environment which demonstrates that children at ARIS possess the tools to engage positively with the world at a local, national and global level. By having 4 Golden rules of Respect, Co-operation, Honesty and Compassion children are always reminded about these tenets within the manifestation of acceptable behavior.</p><blockquote>&ldquo;O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people&hellip;..

We currently offer Arabic, English, French and Hindi. We also provide Arabic Language classes on Saturdays. This latter programme caters for more than 120 students from other schools in Ghana.</p><p>Equally, we encourage students to recognize and grow from their own cultural roots.

Doing so is an important part of the learning process: learning to discover, learning to listen to other people&rsquo;s points of view, learning when to insist and when to compromise, learning in practice the basic principles of the democratic process, learning that actions have consequences, learning about taking responsibility and being accountable to others, including the electorate.</p><p>The SRC is small.

Most importantly, the policy is <em>inclusive</em> rather than <em>exclusive,</em> enabling, insofar as is possible, equity of access to the high quality learning environment that ARIS strives to offer.</p><p>This document depicts the relevant policy and its context, outlines certain of the procedures whereby the policy is effected, and where further explanation may be appropriate, provides some account of the rationale.</p><p>The roots of ARIS are grounded in an indigenous Ghanaian population. However, the student body also reflects much diversity, stemming from relatively mobile families often linked to the world beyond Ghana\'s borders and beyond the region of West Africa via, for example, commercial businesses (at sole trader, corporate and multinational levels), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) charitable foundations and diplomatic missions.</p><p>Collectively, youngsters (now at any age between 4 and 16) whose parents seek their enrolment are exposed to an international <em>Weltanschauung</em> from the outset, if only by reason of peer diversity. International-mindedness is stimulated by everyday social interactions as well as the intrinsic elements of the school\'s globally-referenced curricular content, which is conducive to developing global perspectives.</p><p>A key tenet of the ARIS Mission Statement and Aims is non-discrimination:</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"mission\">Mission</h3><p><em>Al-Rayan International School is a multicultural, non-discriminatory community of learners committed to motivating students to attain their fullest potential through broad-based, world-class curricula that promote critical thinking, foster self-motivation, and encourage self-development.</em></p><p><em>The school is dedicated to nurturing creative, resilient and socially responsible students able to take initiative, and endowed with the knowledge, skills and global awareness necessary to continue their education and become active contributors to the global community.</em></p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"aims\">Aims</h3><p><em> By 2018, Al-Rayan International School will be recognized nationally and internationally as a leading international school in Ghana, providing a stimulating multicultural learning environment in accordance with the best international standards in education. . . </em></p><p>The above Mission and Aims are congruent in all respects with the International Baccalaureate Mission Statement.</p><p>Although sponsored by a charitable foundation, The Ghana Society for Islamic Education and Reformation (GSIER), ARIS is a private school largely funded by revenue from tuition fees. Some potential students, therefore, will be unable to enrol because of the (albeit modest) cost of tuition. Establishment of a scholarship fund will be considered as soon as financial circumstances permit.</p><p>A further limitation on a wholly inclusive Admissions Policy is the provision of facilities for the disabled, which are currently inadequate. Again, when financial circumstances permit, improvements will be made in this regard. It is possible that the Student Representative Council will decide to initiate a fund-raising exercise to accelerate such improvements.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"foundation\">Admission to Playgroup</h3><p>We would like to introduce you to the first stage of school life, known as the Early Years Foundation Stage-EYFS.

No entry exam required from Nursery through year 2.</p><p>For all other admissions; the child should have reached the appropriate age to enter such class, please refer to Year/Class/Grade chart. We place students into the appropriate class based on their age on 31 December of their year of entry. A level assessment is required for enrolment in years 3-6. The assessment is to determine level and not admission. Pupils are placed in a class with his/her age group. In exceptional cases, the cut-off date may be extended for special placement if:</p><ul><li>The cut-off date in the child&rsquo;s country of origin</li><li>The child&rsquo;s successful completion of the equivalent grade elsewhere</li><li>A transcript or report cards from the previous year demonstrating exceptional academic performance and social skills</li></ul><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3>Admission to Primary Years Programme (PYP) - Support Programme</h3><p>All pupils who come under the English as a Second Language (ESL), Special Education Needs (SEN), Individual Education Plan (IEP), or Individual Language Plan (ILP) are placed in a support programme under the direct supervision of that department. Eligibility is based on our ability to provide service to the applicant; and the potential of the applicant to benefit from the Special Educational services available. When it appears that it could be beneficial for the student, he or she might be placed in a lower grade than requested.</p><p>The final decision on grade placement will be taken by the school based on all the information gathered through the application process. ARIS reserves the right to deny admission or re-enrolment to any applicant if, in its opinion, there were reasons to believe that admission or re-enrolment would not be in the best interest of the applicant or ARIS. We also reserve the right to postpone admission, if a class is full. In this case, the applicant is placed on a waiting list. The qualified applicants are then accepted in order of date of application, subject to the above priorities.</p><p>The final decision on grade placement will be taken by the school Principal based on all the information gathered through the application process.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission7-9\">Admission to Years 7 &ndash; 9</h3><p>By now the reader will be asking &lsquo;What exactly must my child do to enrol at ARIS?\' The reader should already have clicked the &lsquo;Contact Us\' button on the ARIS website and begun to engage in the form-filling and information-gathering process.</p><p>Because youngsters in different parts of the world begin formal schooling at markedly different chronological ages, a useful preliminary reference might be the chart (on the website) showing the correlation between chronological age and the Year/Class/Grade levels at ARIS. The terminology at ARIS uses &lsquo;Year\', such as a student in Year 6, in Year 9, or whatever.</p><p>The first point of reference for ARIS personnel handling admissions is the applicant student\'s current and/or previous school report(s). A judgement will be made as to the extent to which the report is authentic and a reliable basis for decisions.</p><p>If the child is age-appropriate for Years 7 &ndash; 9, s/he will sit, under examination conditions, a minimum of three entrance tests, in English Language (the medium of instruction in the school), Mathematics and Science respectively. Because the tests are security sensitive, there is no advance notice or other indication of their content.</p><p>The entrance tests are not centred on any one national educational system. To provide valid assessments of the academic attainment and potential of applicants from varied educational origins and educational backgrounds the content of the tests and the assessment instruments used are also varied; diverse in nature to reflect an international perspective and to ensure equity of access.</p><p>The entrance tests and the school report(s) inform the appropriate placement of new students and provide prospective teachers with a profile of the applicant\'s attainment in the relevant subject areas. The tests also function as a diagnostic instrument, highlighting anomalies and providing the basis of an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) compiled by the Special Educational Needs Coordinator. As the title indicates, the IEP is specific to the student. It directly addresses his or her academic needs, identifies &lsquo;SMART\' goals, appropriate teaching strategies to reach them, and a timeline for review.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission10-11\">Admission to Years 10 and 11 (IGCSE)</h3><p>The entrance tests and IEPs as described above are appropriate to applicants for Years 7 &ndash; 9 at any point in the academic year. External applicants, seeking entry to Year 10 at the start of the academic year, will sit tests in the subjects they plan to offer for the International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE), the courses spanning Years 10 and 11.</p><p>If after the commencement of the academic year an applicant is seeking admission to either Year 10 or 11, entrance tests are of necessity closely focused on the syllabus content of the desired courses. Because courses at IGCSE frequently involve optional content, perhaps unique syllabus choices and pedagogical interpretations made by individual teachers, there is much less flexibility in the admissions process, and transition from one school to another is potentially disruptive to the applicant\'s academic progress. The more time which has elapsed since the beginning of the IGCSE course, the more difficult it will be fully to meet the needs of the applicant. A lot of catch-up work may be required, or in extreme cases a subject may need to be abandoned altogether. The ARIS Faculty can be relied upon to do their utmost to resolve such problems in the best interests of the student.</p><p>Appropriate placement in an IGCSE (or IBDP) course can therefore only be achieved when the subject matter already covered by the applicant substantially matches that already covered in the course(s) to which s/he seeks admission. If there is not substantial overlap, bringing the new student into alignment with the progress already made by his or her peers, particularly in content-laden subjects, may be impossible. Subjects where greater emphasis is placed on skills rather than content may be less problematic.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"admission12\">Admission to Year 12 (IBDP)</h3><p>Admission of ARIS students to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is not automatic. Scheduled in March each year is the first phase of DP orientation for Year 11 students. It is designed to facilitate a clear understanding of the IBDP in general, and its interpretation, principles and practices at ARIS in particular.</p><p>Before addressing the individual circumstances of each student, the first phase of the IBDP orientation is predicated on the assumption that every student will be offering the full Diploma: the core of Creativity, Action, Service (CAS), Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and the Extended Essay (EE), plus three Higher and three Standard Level subjects. Students\' preliminary subject choices will be similarly predicated, and similarly ambitious.</p><p>All students at IBDP level in ARIS will be expected to meet the Creativity, Action, Service (CAS) requirements and fully to participate in TOK classes. It is important that all students have a strong grasp of the underlying philosophy of the DP, and that whatever permutation of subjects they may offer, according to their individual circumstances and needs (perhaps a restricted range leading to certificates), they do not engage in their DP subjects in isolation, but have a sense of the holistic nature of the programme, its intention to educate the whole person, and its potential impact on their future lives.</p><p>The IBDP is academically rigorous. To be assured of a subject profile that enables eligibility for the award of the full Diploma, students should be seeking to attain at least six IGCSE subject passes at grade C or better, including English Language, a Science and Mathematics. For the three subjects to be taken at Higher Level, students should be seeking grades of B, A or A*.</p><p>A great many considerations, of course, must be taken into account in the construction of a DP subject profile appropriate to the individual student. The profile will accommodate as far as possible a recognition of the intelligences of the student, and his or her abilities, potentials and aspirations. And the process of constructing a profile extends beyond the empirically verifiable evidence of academic ability to less readily quantified attributes of the person, such as commitment, attitude, altruism and sense of responsibility to others. Attributes, perhaps, that mirror the IB Learner Profile, and which engagement with the DP will continue to cultivate.</p><p>ARIS is proud of the many ways support is provided to new students, particularly those facing language difficulties, and/or whose academic background (for whatever reason) signifies deficiencies in syllabus coverage or competencies in essential areas of the curriculum, such as mathematics and the sciences. The IEPs are devised and implemented to ensure that students experiencing these difficulties are soon able to match the progress of their peers.</p><p><em> &lsquo;Will this prospective student benefit from the educational programme available at ARIS?\' </em> That is the question which informs all decisions on admission.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p>','','normal','admissions-policy',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2015-03-27 12:41:35',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(37,'Admissions Procedure',5,NULL,'<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/admissions-procedure.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Admission is conditional upon parental agreement that students will participate fully in the curriculum and all related activities.&nbsp; The school curriculum does not include elements that would be disrespectful to any race or religion.</p><p>The School has a limited capacity and at times may have to operate with a waiting list; in that event priority is given to siblings of current students in good standing.&nbsp; Children will be asked to take a test to demonstrate an appropriate level of English competence relevant to their age group.&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s place on the waiting list is determined by the date the application is completed and all documentation and payments are received.</p><p>Once the admission documentation has been received and if it is realistic that a place will become available, the school will arrange an admission assessment.

This may take the form of slapping, pinching, punching, shaking, kicking, burning, shoving or grabbing. The injury may take the form of bruises, cuts, burns or fractures.</p>\n\n<h4>Emotional abuse</h4>\n	<p>Emotional abuse is a chronic attack on a child or young person\'s self esteem. It can take the form of name calling, threatening, ridiculing, intimidating or isolating the child or young person. </p>\n<h4>Neglect</h4>\n	<p>Neglect is the failure to provide the child with the basic necessities of life (where such necessities are available), such as food, clothing, shelter and supervision to the extent that the child\'s health and development are at risk.</p>\n<h4>Child Sexual Abuse</h4>\n	<p>Sexual abuse is when a child or young person is used by an older or bigger child, adolescent or adult for his or her own sexual stimulation or gratification, or economic gain.</p>\n\n<h3>Awareness</h3>\n\n	<p>ARIS will ensure that all staff and others are aware of the problem of child abuse and the risks to children.</p>\n\n<h4>Training and Development </h4>\n	<p>All staff will receive information relating to ARIS’ Child Protection Policy during the induction process. Further training will be provided during INSET training for staff.</p>\n\n<h3>Prevention</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that through awareness and personal and professional conduct, that staff and others minimize the risk to children.</p>\n\n<h4>Vigilance in Recruitment and Selection</h4>\n<p>The Human Resources team and Administration Office adhere by strict guidelines in the recruiting process of new staff, consultants, volunteers and interns. The recruitment guidelines will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that they accurately reflect child safe recruiting and screening standards. The recruitment guidelines will include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A clear and bold statement that confirms ARIS’s commitment to child protection in all contracts </li>\n<li>Adopting ‘best practice’ recruitment and selection techniques </li>\n<li>Conducting reference checks </li>\n<li>Conducting police checks where required and feasible </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Police Checks</h4>\n\n<p>All personnel who work with children will be asked to sign an authority for a police check. In addition, police checks will be conducted for all full-time, part-time and long-term contract employees, regardless of whether or not they work with children.</p> \n<p>In cases where international and national criminal record checks cannot be completed in time or where a country does not provide criminal record checks with adequate reliability, rigorous referee checks will be used in its place. </p>\n\n\n<h4>Code of Conduct</h4>\n\n<p>All staff, consultants and volunteers will be expected to sign and adhere to a Code of Conduct for the Protection of the Child</p>\n\n<h4>Use of Child Photos and Information</h4>\n\n<p>Pictures, images, or other likenesses of children and/or information related to children that could compromise their care and protection will not be made available through any form of communication media without proper protection and understanding of their use. Moreover, any images of children should not be accompanied by detailed information.</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that staff and others are clear about what steps to take where concerns arise regarding the safety of children.</p>\n\n<h4>Incident reporting</h4>\n<p>It is mandatory for any allegation, belief or suspicion of sexual or physical abuse (past or present) by an ARIS employee, sponsor, donor, board member or other partner to be reported immediately to the Child Protection Officer or the Principal Office. </p>\n<p>If a child reports an incident, the child/young person must be taken seriously and listened to carefully. Once an allegation is made there should be an immediate response that protects the child from further potential abuse or victimization. Where appropriate, the family of the child victim should be informed of the allegation and action proposed and they should be consulted where possible as to the process to be followed. This process will be steered and guided by the Child Protection Officer and Principal.</p>\n<p>Al-Rayaan International School has a Child Protection reporting procedure that takes into account the local context of Ghana and the culture of the child involved.</p> \n\n<h4>Document the incident</h4>\n\n<p>As soon as possible (within a period of 24 hours of the disclosure), the staff member receiving the disclosure needs to have fully documented the allegation, including the time, place, witnesses. This report will possibly be used in court if charges are forthcoming. </p>\n<p>All reports should be submitted to the Child protection officer who will discuss the case with the Principal and the School Executive Board.</p> \n<p>If any staff member is alleged to have committed or been arrested for, or convicted of, criminal offences relating to child abuse then the staff’s contract will be immediately terminated and the case transferred to the school’s Disciplinary Committee.</p> \n<p>If the incident occurs in Ghana or involves a Ghanaian, the Executive Board will consult with legal counsel and all appropriate bodies (e.g., Police, Department of Family and Community Services, Human Services…), to ascertain due process and steer participants accordingly, subject to the incident reported.</p> \n<p>If the incidence involves an international staff (non-Ghanaian), then the appropriate embassies and bodies (Police, Immigration…) will also be contacted and consulted.</p>\n\n<h3>Responding</h3>\n<p>ARIS will ensure that action is taken to support and protect children where concerns arise regarding possible abuse. </p>\n<h4>Distance the alleged perpetrator </h4>\n<p>The best interests of the child/young person may warrant the standing down of a staff member, consultant or volunteer while an investigation commences. Staff members stood down receive full pay and are entitled to a just process that does not pre-suppose guilt or innocence. The allegations should not be discussed or communicated to other people until such have been considered and a decision made by the school’s Disciplinary Committee. The decision made should be documented and filed.</p>\n<h4>Confidentiality </h4>\n<p>Confidentiality is crucial to a fair and effective reporting procedure. It is unacceptable and potentially defamatory for concerns of child abuse (and abusers) to be spread throughout the school body rather than being directed through a formal complaints process. All participants must understand the importance of following the set reporting lines when concerns arise. Confidentiality protects the child, the notifier, the respondent and the school, and ensures a fair and proper process.</p>\n\n<h4>Reprisal </h4>\n<p>ARIS will not tolerate any form of coercion, intimidation, reprisal or retaliation against any employee who reports any form of abuse or exploitation, provides any information or other assistance in an investigation. </p>\n<h4>Counseling support </h4>\n<p>Professional counseling support will be made available to all parties involved.</p>\n<h4>Investigation of complaints </h4>\n<p>Physical and/or sexual abuse of a child is a crime. ARIS may be required to notify authorities when there are reasonable grounds for reporting abuse, particularly if the allegations are made in Ghana or involve a Ghanaian citizen.  Allegations involving international staff and students will need to consider international and national legislation and procedures to investigate and address the allegations. ARIS will work closely with relevant Embassies and governments to resolve such allegations.

Regular class attendance is a must for fulfilling the many requirements and assignments in all subjects, and for completing each course of study satisfactorily. Erratic attendance will inevitably impede the rate of progress, limit the student&rsquo;s potential achievements and negatively affect his or her academic record. Permanently.</p><p>It should be self-evident that students learn through participation in class; they learn through interaction with the teacher, with their peers, through discussion, tests, quizzes, written work and examinations. The student, therefore, must be in class to progress. The classroom (or Science Lab, or Library or Multimedia Resource Centre, for example) is the focus of the learning dynamic and being a part of that dynamic is absolutely essential.</p><p>Furthermore, if any student(s) is/are absent it potentially disrupts the learning and success of others. The absentee may, for instance, be involved in a collaborative or group project, where progress of a number of other students may be negatively affected. The grades of students who conscientiously attend school may suffer as a consequence of the erratic attendance of their less conscientious classmates. There are no inbuilt compensatory mechanisms to prevent this happening, and it may even negatively impact examination results at IGCSE and Diploma Programme level.</p><p>Or the teacher, whose time, obviously, is finite, may be obliged to divert his or her attention from whole-class activities/learning to attend to the absentee&rsquo;s knowledge gaps and bring him or her &lsquo;up to speed.&rsquo; Simply because of one student&rsquo;s casual attitude.</p><p>Regular, punctual attendance is therefore non-negotiable and required of every student.</p><h4>Purpose of the Attendance Policy</h4><p>It is intended that this policy, the implementation of which involves a collaborative effort on the part of the entire school community, that is students, parents, staff and the Board, gives clear, practical guidance as to the means of monitoring, maintaining and if necessary improving the levels of attendance expected, without exception, of every student.</p><p>The Attendance Policy has been designed to ensure:</p><ul><li>that all members of the school community are clearly aware of their responsibilities</li><li>consistency and coherence of class teaching, thus enabling all students to achieve outstanding levels of achievement, progress and personal growth.</li></ul><h4>Absences</h4><p>Students should therefore be absent only for necessary and important reasons, such as illness or family/personal emergency. Parents may excuse their children from school for such reasons, but ARIS may at its own discretion not honour parent-signed excuses on other pretexts. Because of the inevitable toll on academic progress in particular, the school seeks willing co-operation from parents in exercising the utmost restraint in excusing their children from school.</p><h5>Authorised/Excused Absences</h5><p>A student may be excusably absent from school due to personal illness, death in the family, emergency dental or medical treatment, religious holiday, procurement of essential documents, renewal of passports, or other vital reasons if approved in advance by the Head of Secondary. <strong>If at all possible, medical/dental appointments during school hours must be avoided.</strong></p><h5>Unauthorised/Unexcused Absences</h5><p>Unexcused absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Head of Secondary. Work missed for such absences must be completed but will be not be given credit and will be graded zero. Unexcused absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p><h4>Truancy</h4><p>Truancy is considered to be a student missing part or all of the school day without parental and theschool\'s permission, and is treated as very serious offence. Leaving campus without permissionduring the school day constitutes truancy. Not least because of safety and security considerations,the school will immediately attempt to contact the parents if the student is inexplicably absent.</p><p>Obviously, truancy has a deleterious effect on the student\'s educational progress. The Head of Secondary is responsible for dealing with truancy and the consequences thereof. Disciplinary action may entail up to three days suspension, which will remain permanently on the student&rsquo;s record.</p><h4>Consequences of Unexcused Absences</h4><p>Because tertiary institutions responsible for the next phase of any student&rsquo;s education will require evidence, the record of attendance routinely becomes a permanent entry on a student&rsquo;s file. It is also a requirement under the laws of Ghana.</p><p>If poor attendance persists, it may be necessary to have the student repeat all or part of the school year, or to request that the parents withdraw the student from the school.</p><p>A student absent for six days or more (excused or unexcused) during the term will receive formal acknowledgement of school attendance only upon review of the circumstances of the absences and the final level of achievement in work undertaken. At the discretion of the Head of Secondary, additional assessment may be required to fulfil the course requirements.</p><p>Compensation (make-up) for extended absences for medical reasons should be arranged through the subject teacher(s) in consultation with the Head of Secondary. Students are responsible for making up all missed work, whether or not an absence was excused. Credit will not be given for work made up after an unexcused absence and accordingly will be zero-graded.</p><p>The Faculty will make reasonable efforts to assist students in making up school work for excused absences, but will also be mindful, as stated previously, that in doing so their attention may be diverted from the needs of the majority of students in the class. Students absent on the day of a test are expected to make up the test immediately on return to school and may be required to do this during break time.</p><h3>Procedures</h3><h4>Responsibility</h4><p>The Head of Secondary is responsible for setting and overseeing attendance procedures, and for ensuring that:</p><ul><li>attendance is checked and reported daily</li><li>a daily record of attendance is maintained and logged, and</li><li>written explanations are submitted by parents for all absences.</li></ul><h4>Registration Procedure</h4><p>Registration of student attendance is a national, legal requirement.</p><p>Every Secondary School student is assigned to a Homeroom, corresponding with their Year group.</p><p>Following the daily Faculty briefing, registration of student attendance is taken by the Homeroom Teachers at 08.00. The Attendance Registers are closed at 08.05.</p><p>Students must always bring a note from parents/guardians explaining an absence. This must be given to the Homeroom Teacher at registration on the first day of return to school.</p><h4>Late Arrivals</h4><p>If students arrive in the Homeroom after the Register has been closed at 08.05, they will be recorded as &lsquo;Late&rsquo;. Three &lsquo;Latenesses&rsquo; equate to one full day&rsquo;s absence. A cumulative record of absences will be maintained on file.</p><p>Students who arrive after 08.15 must report directly to the Reception Desk and sign the Late Book, entering their time of arrival and the explanation for their being late. They will be given a Late Pass by the Receptionist. When the student arrives at the lesson with a Late Pass, s/he must submit it to the teacher, who will decide if and when the student will be admitted to the class.</p><h4>Non-Attendance</h4><p>In the event of illness or other unforeseen absence, parents are requested to call Reception and report the student&rsquo;s absence by 08.00 latest. They should then follow-up with an explanatory note on the student&rsquo;s return to class. When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a form for the duration of the planned absence and return it to their Homeroom Teacher.</p><p>The absence will be classified as unexcused until an adequate explanation is received. Parents should notify Reception each day of the absence, unless the Head of Secondary has been notified of a prolonged absence in advance.</p><h4>Follow-up Procedures</h4><p>The following time quota apply from the start of any one academic year.</p><ul><li>Parents will be contacted by the ARIS Administrator when the student has reached six days of unexcused absence.</li><li>Parents will be informed in writing by the ARIS Administrator when the student has reached 12 days of unexcused absence.</li><li>A final telephone call will be made by the ARIS Administrator to parents when the student has reached 16 days of unexcused absence.</li><li>When the student has been absent for 18 days, the parents will receive notification in writing that the student will not be allowed to return to school the following year.</li><li>If a student is absent for more than 30 days, s/he will not be able to return to school without the approval of the Board.</li></ul><h4>Appointments during the Day</h4><p>Students may only leave during the school day if collected by a designated responsible adult and 24 hours&rsquo; prior notice has been given to the Homeroom Teacher. The responsible adult must first report to Reception and must be accompanied to the classroom to collect the student.</p>',NULL,'normal','attendance-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:30:11','2015-03-03 19:37:45',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(66,'Network Policy',15,NULL,'<p><img src=\"/img/uploads/pages/network-policy.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p><p>Note: This policy includes a summation of the rules by which students and staff are expected to abide when using the Network and ICT facilities at ARIS.</p><h3>Definition</h3><p>\'The Network\' denotes the ARIS Intranet, Local Area Network (LAN) and access to the Internet by whatever means or device (eg desktop, laptop, tablet, phablet, smartphone).</p><h3>Aims</h3><p>The Network is an educational resource enabling a learning environment where students and teachers:</p><ul><li>integrate on-line access with their approaches to teaching and learning</li><li>have immediate access to abundant information resources, using them to their full potential</li><li>can themselves make continuous improvements to the learning process</li><li>are abreast of, and can participate in contemporary developments, discussions, trends, ideas and innovations</li><li>can engage in distance teaching and learning, and pursue courses online that are not available face-to-face within the school</li><li>minimise negative impacts on the environment</li><li>acquire, exercise, share and improve IT skills appropriate to education in the digital age.</li></ul><h3>Objectives</h3><ul><li>To give access to on-line information in general, and the Internet in particular, to students and staff</li><li>To ensure that access is secure, economical and appropriate</li><li>To ensure that the information gathered is used appropriately.</li></ul><h3>Acceptable use guidelines</h3><ul><li>All students must conform to current school rules in terms of acceptable behaviour and the use of school facilities.</li><li>Behaviour on the Network must be in support of education and research and must be consistent with the educational aims and objectives of ARIS.</li><li>Students are personally responsible and accountable for what they say and do while using the Network.</li></ul><p>Because communication with thousands of others is so quick and easy, it is important for students to reflect before acting and to show respect for other people and their ideas.</p><ul><li>Students should not attempt to pass off Internet information as their own.

It should be our responsibility to inculcate these values of honesty and integrity in our students from an early age and to do our best to ensure that these values last.</p><p>This policy document, focused on Academic Honesty, is intended to be concise, and stems from, and is coherent with, the school&rsquo;s commitment to academic honesty and integrity. Academic honesty is a fundamental tenet of the ARIS philosophy and accordingly is integral to the life-long values which ARIS aims to inculcate in its students, from Primary Years to the Diploma Programme.</p><p>A prior assumption is that ARIS students and teachers are honest by nature, proud of that, and wish to remain so. An important educational aim for ARIS teachers, however, is to reinforce that innate honesty and thus enable students to derive satisfaction from their own accomplishments, secure in the knowledge that their accomplishments are indeed their own.</p><p>Academic honesty should be seen as a set of values, reinforced by skills that promote personal integrity and good practice in teaching, learning and assessment. Academic honesty is influenced and shaped by a variety of factors including peer pressure, culture, parental expectations, role- modelling and taught skills. Academic dishonesty may stem from similar origins: your classmates are getting away with it, why shouldn\'t you? Your own culture respects emulation of those recognised as the finest practitioners. Therefore copy the best. If you fail, you fail your family. And so on.</p><p>It is argued here that although it is easier to explain to students what constitutes academic dishonesty, with direct reference to examples of plagiarism, collusion and cheating in exams, whenever possible the topic should be treated by teachers in a positive way, stressing the educational benefits which accrue when, for example, academic research is properly conducted, when the temptation to take shortcuts is resisted, and when the borrowing or outright theft of someone else\'s ideas and presenting them as one\'s own is seen as reprehensible.</p><p>This policy document includes:</p><ul><li>possible definitions of what constitutes academic dishonesty, malpractice, plagiarism and intellectual property</li><li>an account of the consequences of academic dishonesty at ARIS and the suggested consequences that will occur if a student is found guilty</li><li>examples of conventions for citing and acknowledging original authorship</li><li>guidance on the distinction between legitimate collaboration and unacceptable collusion (different from collaboration) or plagiarism.</li></ul><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"academicdishonestyandmalpractice\">ACADEMIC DISHONESTY AND MALPRACTICE</h2><h3>Definition of terms</h3><p>The IBO regulations, for example, define malpractice as behaviour that results in, or may result in, the student gaining an unfair advantage (relative to other students) in one or more assessment components. Malpractice includes:</p><ul><li><strong>plagiarism:</strong> this is defined as the representation of the ideas or work of another person as the student\'s own</li><li><strong>collusion:</strong> this is defined as supporting malpractice by another student, as in allowing one&rsquo;s work to be copied or submitted for assessment by another</li><li><strong>duplication</strong> of work: this is defined as the presentation of the same work for different subjects, assessment components and/or requirements</li><li>the taking of unauthorised material into an examination room, or disrupting an examination</li><li><strong>any other behaviour that gains an unfair advantage</strong> for a student or that affects the results of another student.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that malpractice, unfortunately, is not confined to offences by students.</p><p>The intellectual property of others may also be misused. Intellectual property is property that is the result of creativity. It does not exist in tangible, legal form, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks et cetera, but is nevertheless the product of another person\'s work. Examples include a variety of sources (CD-ROMs, DVDs, photographs, illustrations, art works, music and data) in addition to journals, books and web sites.</p><p>Students and teachers must be aware that the requirement to acknowledge sources extends beyond text taken from the Internet, CD-ROMs, books, magazines and journals. The concepts of intellectual property and academic honesty include, for example, the use of footnotes or endnotes to acknowledge the source of an idea if that idea emerged as a result of discussion with, or listening to, a fellow student, a teacher or any other person.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"consequences\">THE CONSEQUENCES OF MALPRACTICE</h2><p>While ARIS does its utmost to develop in students the highest ethical standards in academic work, there may arise occasions when those standards are breached. The table overleaf is intended to provide examples of breaches of academic honesty, in various contexts, and their recommended consequences. It is not exhaustive. A basic premise is that academic dishonesty is a gross breach of the educational values which ARIS attempts to inculcate; therefore all proven cases of academic dishonesty should be:</p><ul><li>followed by the stated disciplinary action (consequence)</li><li>permanently documented in the student\'s file</li><li>reported in writing to the parents/guardians.</li></ul><p>In spite of what was stated on the first page of this paper, ie that malpractice entails a deliberate attempt to gain academic advantage, it will almost invariably be difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the attempt to gain academic advantage was intentional. Hence, should evidence of intention to deceive be uncovered, or should the intention be admitted by the suspect, it should not be held as key to the proof of malpractice, rather, it should be considered as corroboratory. The \' key to the proof of malpractice\' is the documentary or other evidence.</p><p>Investigations of suspicions of academic dishonesty should be conducted in a heuristic, rather than an inquisitorial, confrontational or adversarial style. The aim of an investigation should be to discover the truth of the matter, rather than to intimidate or threaten the student suspected. The student should be entitled to have a witness or a trusted teacher present if s/he so chooses. Not, however, a parent, guardian or lawyer whose independence of judgement may be compromised.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h2 id=\"typesof\">TYPES OF MALPRACTICE &amp; CONTEXT / SUGGESTED CONSEQUENCES</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Offence<sup>1</sup></th><th>Context<sup>2</sup></th><th>Suggested Consequence</th></tr><tr><td>plagiarism</td><td>Homework/class tests</td><td>Disciplinary action as appropriate, mark of zero awarded and loss of grade.

The context in which malpractice has been proven is not necessarily relevant to the gravity of the offence. Other factors, such the extent to which a piece of work has been plagiarised, the extent to which other students may be complicit in the offence, and the number (if any) of previous proven cases on the part of the offending student should be the main determinants of disciplinary measures.</li><li>The IBO has detailed and stringently applied procedures for dealing with academic malpractice that extend beyond the scope of this document. All cases are considered by the IBO Final Award Committee. Preventative vigilance is the collective responsibility of IBDP teachers. Notification to the IBO of proven instances of malpractice is the responsibility of the IBDP Coordinator.</li></ol><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"detection\">The detection of plagiarism</h3><p>It is the ARIS student who should be ultimately responsible for ensuring that all work submitted for assessment is authentic, not the teacher or the EE supervisor (though of course they have a major responsibility). The work or ideas of others must be fully and correctly cited and acknowledged. Students should be expected to review their own work before submission for assessment to identify any passages, data, graphs, photographs, computer programmes and so on that still require acknowledgment.</p><p>The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, published in August 2014 and available on the OCC, provides useful guidance as to why, when, what and how to cite source materials. Teachers should familiarise students with the content of this document when appropriate.</p><p>When reading students\' work teachers should be vigilant for obvious changes in the style of writing. Equally significant is a style that seems too mature, too error free and perhaps more characteristic of an experienced academic than a secondary school student. Evidence of copying and pasting may immediately be obvious from inconsistent fonts and/or kerning.</p><p>Over the period of the courses in the Primary and Secondary Schools teachers will, or at least should, become very familiar with the style and quality of each student\'s work in their classes. It is therefore the teachers who are in the best position to identify work that may not be authentic, and if the student knows the teacher is vigilant, s/he may be less tempted to resort to plagiarism in times of stress or crisis. If such stresses or crises occur, the student should be encouraged to seek the solace of the Guidance Counsellor. Malpractice, whether detected or not, will only exacerbate emotional stress.</p><p>Although in most cases of plagiarism that come to the attention of the Examining Boards the candidate has copied passages from a web site, there is still frequent plagiarism from books and journals, in addition to the illicit use of photographs, graphs, data and computer programmes from a variety of sources. In many cases it is likely that the teacher is familiar with the books being used by candidates; they may be standard textbooks for the subject, or books that are readily available in the school library. The author of this paper knows of one instance where the teacher himself was the author of the work plagiarised.</p><p>The teacher must be alert for familiar passages or fragments of passages loosely assembled, perhaps without grammatical or ideational coherence. If necessary, the teacher should check that such passages have not been copied from elsewhere. In the first instance, a mere chat with the student about the content of the suspect work may reveal that the student has only a superficial understanding of what s/he has written.</p><p>To be introduced to the Theory of Knowledge assessment for the May 2015 examination session, but not yet available at the time of writing (October 2014) is a requirement that in the course of the students&rsquo; preparation of the essay on a Prescribed Title teachers conduct several &lsquo;interactions&rsquo; with the student author. This is to ensure that the essay has guided by an appropriate level of professional input from the designated teacher and/or class discussions, and not by an internet mentor (a euphemism for someone paid to write the essay on behalf of the student). It could be argued that, had TOK teachers collectively been more vigilant in the prevention of plagiarism, such draconian counter-measures at the strategic level would never have been necessary.</p><p>In the IBDP, at least, assessment is an integral element of the curriculum. Academic malpractice at times appears to be driving assessment development regressively, in directions less and less conducive to the optimal teaching and learning context.</p><p>With the growth of the Internet and corresponding increase in its use, the abuse of electronic media is now, sadly, prevalent within the academic community. Aside from the immense number of legitimate websites, there are an increasing number of sites that actively encourage students to plagiarise and purchase essays, such as the TOK one mentioned. Little can be done to prevent the emergence of these sites, but the Internet can also be used for detecting academic dishonesty. Several of the more efficient search engines can be used to detect the source of passages that have been plagiarised, although with the exponential growth in the quantity of stored data this is becoming less and less feasible.</p><p>There are several websites that offer a useful service in detecting plagiarism from the Internet, for example, http://turnitin.com to which ARIS may decide to maintain a subscription. Again, however, it must be stressed that software of this kind can easily be circumvented; there is no substitute for the teachers&rsquo; vigilance. The discussions among teachers new to this type of software often indicate that the teachers have not themselves internalised the ability to differentiate qualitatively between examples of plagiarised and examples of authentic student work. They are reliant instead on seemingly authoritative, computer-generated indicators of &lsquo;percentage copied&rsquo;, prettily colour coded; indicators which may be themselves be based on spurious data. It is important that ARIS teachers develop, over time, the ability to identify atypical work.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"authenticating\">Authenticating candidates&rsquo; work</h3><p>It is the responsibility of teachers to support students in the preparation of their work for assessment and to ensure that all student work complies with the requirements of the relevant curriculum guidelines. Therefore, teachers (or supervisors in the case of IB Extended Essays) are in by far the best position to judge whether a candidate&rsquo;s work is authentic. Ongoing support and guidance will help with the early detection of unintentional plagiarism and will dissuade students from deliberate plagiarism because they know their work is regularly subject to scrutiny. However, what is realistic and what can be achieved within the usual constraints of time and workload must be left to the discretion of teachers and the relevant coordinator.</p><p>As previously stated, the candidates are ultimately responsible for ensuring that the final version of any work is authentic. Candidates themselves must bear the consequences if they submit any work for assessment that is not their own, regardless of whether the plagiarism was unintentional or deliberate. The same principle applies to collusion.</p><p>If the coordinator and/or a teacher has reason to believe that part or the whole of a candidate&rsquo;s draft work submitted for discussion prior to final submission might be deemed to be in violation of the principles of academic honesty and constitutes a case of malpractice, they must draw the candidate&rsquo;s attention to this risk and to her/his duty to respect the policy and requirements of academic honesty.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"bibliographies\">Bibliographies, references and citations</h3><p>All work submitted for assessment must reflect intellectual honesty in research practices and provide the reader with the exact sources of quotations, ideas and points of view through accurate bibliographies and referencing. The IBO Policy document &lsquo;Effective Citing and Referencing&rsquo;, (mentioned on page 4) is a useful resource for both students and teacher.</p><p>Producing accurate citations, referencing and a bibliography is a skill that students should be seeking to perfect. Documenting the research in this way is vital: it allows readers to evaluate the evidence for themselves and it shows the student&rsquo;s understanding of the importance of the sources used.</p><p><em>Failure to comply with this requirement will be viewed as plagiarism and will, therefore, be treated as a case of malpractice</em>.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisb\">What is a bibliography?</h3><p>A bibliography is an alphabetical list of every source used. Sources that are not cited in the body of the piece of work, but were important in informing the approach taken, should be cited in the introduction or in an acknowledgment. The bibliography should list only those sources cited. Examiners will not be impressed by a long and stylish list that bears little or no connection with the text of the piece of work. Rather, such a list may remind the examiner of the extent of the resources spurned by the student.</p><p>There are a number of different documentation styles available for use when writing research papers at IBDP level; most are appropriate in some academic disciplines but not others. The IB does not mandate use of a particular style, rather that just one be used and presented consistently, and above all, when used as a reference (see below), enables the reader (examiner) to trace the source. If the bibliographical item cannot be accessed on the basis of the information provided, or, if it was transient, contain evidence that it once existed, the information might as well not be there.</p><p>The teacher should help students decide on a citation style for the particular piece of work set. It is important to remember that, whatever style is chosen, it must be simple to use and must be applied consistently. When choosing the style, the student needs to have a clear understanding of how it is to be used before embarking on the work. The style should be applied at all stages in the production of the piece of work. This is good practice, not only for producing a high-quality final product, but also for reducing the opportunities and temptation to plagiarise.</p><p>Finding information about citation/documentation styles is not difficult. Entering a string, such as \'academic referencing\', into an Internet search engine will bring up lots of useful material. Or the student can simply copy the style (not the content) shown in the main textbook used in researching the topic s/he is writing about. That will not be construed as plagiarism!</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisr\">What is a reference?</h3><p>A reference is a way of indicating to the reader, in an orderly and systematic form, where information has been obtained. A reference provides all the information needed to find/trace the source material. References must be included because they acknowledge the sources used, and enable the reader to trace and consult the source work and verify the data that has been presented. If the reference does not enable the reader to trace and consult the source work, then it is useless.</p><p>References must be given whenever someone else&rsquo;s work is quoted or summarized. References can come from many different sources, including books, magazines, journals, newspapers, e-mails, Internet sites and interviews. Internet references should include the title of the extract used as well as the web site address, the date it was accessed and, if possible, its author.</p><p>Caution should be exercised with information on web sites that do not give references or that cannot be cross-checked against other sources. The more important a particular point is to the essay, the more the quality of its source needs to be evaluated. And if a particular source is alluded to time and time again, is reliability and authenticity is all the more important. As a TOK student will know, frequency of reference, which is one of the factors which propel a website to prominence in a web search, is just one test of truth.</p><p>Any references to interviews (transient) should state the name of the interviewer, the name of the interviewee, the date and the place of the interview.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"whatisc\">What is a citation?</h3><p>A citation is a shorthand method of making a reference in the body of an essay, which is then linked to the full reference at the end of the essay. A citation provides the reader with accurate references so that s/he can locate the source easily. How sources are cited varies with the particular documentation style that has been chosen. Page numbers should normally be given when referencing printed material: in some styles this will be in the citation, in others in the full reference. Once again, it is important to emphasise that there must be consistency of method when citing sources. This is not important from the point of view of stylistic elegance, but to facilitate traceability of sources by the examiner/moderator.</p><p><a class=\"noprint\" href=\"#start\">&uarr; Back to Top</a></p><h3 id=\"notes\">Author&rsquo;s note</h3><p>Finally, this policy document was written in connection with and compiled from the publications listed below and, in fulfilment of the advice therein, and the corresponding advice given in this paper, acknowledges extensive use of the IBO material.</p><p><em>Academic Honesty: Guidance for Schools</em> (September 2003), IBO</p><p><em>Academic Honesty: Diploma Programme</em> (September 2007), IBO</p><p><em>Extended Essay: Guide</em> (March 2007), IBO</p><p><em>Academic Honesty in the IB Educational Context</em> (August 2014), IBO</p><p><em>Effective Citing and Referencing</em> (August 2014), IBO</p><p>Trevor Trumper, Diploma Programme Coordinator<br /> Al-Rayan International School, Ghana</p>',NULL,'normal','academic-honesty-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:31:54','2015-03-23 22:07:34',0,'mustapha.hamoui@gmail.com'),(68,'Assessment Policy',15,NULL,'<p>Assessment Policy</p>',NULL,'normal','assessment-policy',NULL,'2014-10-26 09:32:14','2014-10-26 09:32:14',0,NULL),(69,'Security Policy',15,'Some say we live in a dangerous world.

However, these three aspects are so inextricably linked they are best not thought of as discrete processes.</p><p>Language plays a vital role in the construction of meaning. It empowers the learner and provides an intellectual framework to support conceptual development and critical thinking. In the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP), it is recognized that the teaching of language should be in response to the previous experience, needs and interests of the student, rather than the consequence of a predetermined, prescriptive model for delivering language. Fragmenting learning into the acquisition of isolated skill sets can create difficulties for learners&mdash;for example, learners may be able to read, write and spell words correctly in isolation but may not be able to read, write or spell those same words in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Learners&rsquo; needs are best served when they have opportunities to engage in learning within meaningful contexts, rather than being presented with the learning of language as an incremental series of skills to be acquired.</strong></p><p>At ARIS, the language profiles of students in are complex and diverse.

They are identified as dance, drama, music and visual arts. The four areas are a powerful mode of communication through which students explore and construct a sense of self and develop an understanding of the world. Through Arts, students are exposed to a wide range of opportunities and means to respond to their experiences and engage with historical, social and cultural perspectives. At ARIS, our students are stimulated to articulate their thoughts in diverse ways, as well as through technologies. Arts as an Inquiry provides opportunities for learning, communication and expression, as well as promotes creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving skills and social interactions.</p><h3>Dance</h3><p>Dance in the PYP explores how we express ourselves through movement. To understand and respond to dance, students explore how dance is used in various cultures, rituals and social contexts. Exploring dance in a historical and cultural context and through a variety of genres enriches the student&rsquo;s experience in creating and responding to dance. Also, students are inspired to engage in dance performances to express themselves through their creative movements. From Middle Eastern Folk dances to African dances, students of ARIS are given the opportunities to experience other cultures through movement. Hence, students nurture their physical confidence engaging fully their minds and bodies.</p><h3>Drama</h3><p>Drama in the PYP explores how we express ourselves physically and vocally. Through drama, students are able to explore the use of facial expressions, gestures, movement, posture and vocal techniques to convey emotional or cultural meaning to both characters and stories. At ARIS, students engage in different forms of drama, such as role play, sketches, and scripted drama, presenting their performances to an audience or even to their peers to enable them become a critically aware audience members. Furthermore, through Drama pupils acquire skills to develop their own style in dramatic activities, enhancing their journey in the film-making and theatre industries. The use of ICT in drama setting enhances the creative experience, for instance in creating sound-tracks or video editing.</p><h3>Music</h3><p>Music in the PYP allows students to communicate in a unique way, given the opportunities to explore a wide range of music experiences that include classifying and analyzing sounds, composing, exploring body music, harmonizing, listening, playing instruments, singing, notation, reading music, songwriting and recording. By exposing students to a wide range of musical styles, they are able to understand the context of their environment and that of others, and thus begin to develop personal connections with them.</p><p>At ARIS, students draw on a wide range of music from the Ghanaian and Arab media, and from around the world. Students also explore home-made as well as manufactured instruments from a variety of countries and cultures. ICT is also used to enhance learning music by allowing students to create, compose and record their work through the use of music files and CDs.</p><h3>Visual Arts</h3><p>Visual Arts in the PYP includes &ldquo;art, craft and design&rdquo;. Students are exposed to a broad range of experiences that illustrate the field of visual arts, including bookmaking, architecture, ceramics, collage, costume design, drawing, graphic design, film, illustrations, jewelry, mask making, painting, photography, printmaking sculpture, set design, textiles and woodwork.</p><p>Students are encouraged to experience visual arts of others by inviting artists to the school, or by visiting art galleries and museums, exhibitions, film sets or theatres. By being exposed to diverse artists from all over the world, students begin to appreciate the field of visual arts.</p><p>In addition, ICT is used as a tool to enhance creative experience.

When excusable absences can be foreseen, students must complete a planned absence form and return it to their Homeroom Teacher.</p>\n\n<h4>Inexcusable</h4>\n\n<p>Inexcusable absences include truancy, cutting/skipping a class, suspension, absences that have not been followed up with a note from parents, or other reasons not approved by the Head of Secondary.  Work missed for such absences must be completed but will be not be given credit and will be graded as zero.  Inexcusable absences inevitably affect marks and report grades negatively.</p>\n\n<p>Following any non-school related absence from class, students must immediately on their return provide their Homeroom Teacher with a clear written explanation from parents explaining the reason for the absence.

Maud Adjanor is an inherent teacher who is passionate about how children grow. She gained admission into the University of Education, Winneba after teaching for six years in the early years. Maud holds a diploma in Early Childhood Education and has pursued various courses including child psychology, child rights, and educational philosophy just to mention a few. She is currently reading Bachelor of Arts in childhood education at the same University.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">She joined ARIS in 2010 as a teacher in the early year foundation department and has been very involved in the mammoth transformation of the department. She presently is the reception (A) class teacher. Maud trusts that child growth is one aspect of life that the world cannot do away with, and what makes the child a holistic matured being is not only the environment but the experiences and choices that should be carefully guided to help the child. Her ideas are from her inspirations, which come from the word of God.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Maud enjoys exploring in all aspects whether home or school and can create magnificent things out of zilch. Train a child the way he should go and when he grows he will not depart from it. Proverbs 22:6, \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me\" according to Mark 9:37. These are verses Maud believes in.
